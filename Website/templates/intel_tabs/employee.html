                  <li>If you're female and especially a person of color, you'll have a really good chance of being hired, regardless of experience. The emphasis on diversity is strong. Years ago (before this recent push!) we were told that out of the candidates who applied, if we did not choose the woman, we had to justify that to a VP. A VP mind you that has no idea what we actually need. There used to be crazy large referral bonuses the more unique of a hire you could find. Get that koosh large company job, find a nice place to settle in and eventually become a manager that is simply just a warm body in a chair.</li>

                <h4>Negative Comments</h4>
                  <li>Pay and benefits are not competitive.</li>
                  <li>This attitude has given me so much mental stress that I will not wish that on anyone .</li>
                  <li>"Competitive" pay and benefits seem to aim for average; vacation time can be upset by manufacturing and product release cycles; getting things done can be slow and tangled in bureaucracy; significant communication overhead (email, IMs, meetings); coordinating across worldwide times zones is painful; difficult to drive change and improvements; lots of meetings and a seeming expectation to be immediately reachable and interruptible when working; regular reorgs; management often seems disconnected from engineers and engineering work; always stretched thin and understaffed despite having so many employees; business decisions often don't make sense; plenty of mediocre coworkers to suffer through</li>
                  <li>Immigrants in Non-USA Orgs face issues as NON- USA teams or leaders are not properly trained professional to address the culture and values of Intel.</li>
                  <li>Too slow pacing sometimes, outdated culture</li>
                  <li>Internal struggle between culture warriors can cause the company to lose sight of what it's really good at</li>
                  <li>The other issue I have, and this will not be a popular opinion probably, is that I feel that we have gone too far on diversity and inclusion. I am not against any diversity or inclusive activities. Go after people that offend vs telling a manager a diverse candidate is the requirement when the non-diverse candidate is clearly the better choice. There should not be bonus kickers that relate to diverse hiring - that is nothing I can control nor should it be there at all.</li>
                  <li>Learning curve droops fast, not much diversity</li>
                  <li>Culture can be rough depending on where you land in the company</li>
                  <li>Arrogance permeates throughout their ranks, causing them to ignore customer inputs and have a "build it and they will come" mentality. Strong culture of "old boy" network with archaic technical leadership boards serving as the veiled popularity contest judge panel for promoting technical talent.</li>

                  <li>need to improve benefits and 401k</li>
                  <li>location, size of the company,onboarding, trainings, benefits</li>
                  <li>Culture, focus, direction all shake out from this.</li>
                  <li>Less stock benefits.</li>
                  <li>Volatility can be high business direction wise, and as with any company the people in leadership matter and in this case can drive some inconsistencies in the experience and culture.</li>
                  <li>Bureaucratic policies and corporate culture can lead to slow decision times on key issues</li>
                  <li>Need to change work culture to attract more young talent</li>
                  <li>When I started at Intel, the culture was very much about ‘meritocracy’ meaning the rewards were based on what you accomplished and the results you achieved.</li>
                  <li>Could have made even larger chips if the culture stays where it used to be</li>
                  <li>Long hours and lack of bonus / additional benefits</li>
                  <li>bad team culture and people</li>
                  <li>Intel usually beats them in benefits, but most younger people don't care about that as much.</li>
                  <li>Dislike company culture, big campus</li>
                  <li>Locations are less desirable due to lack of diversity.</li>
                  <li>Politics, culture not so good.</li>
                  <li>But the numbers of Latinx and African Anericans most relevant to legacy of US and discrimination is poor. Their diversity numbers look strong for total POC.</li>
                  <li>Culture and Environment and Leadership</li>
                  <li>not much benefits or motivation</li>
                  <li>Annual review culture, folks are quick to pass the blame if something fell short.</li>
                  <li>To their credit one of the Intel benefits is a sabbatical every four to seven years, but it's common for people to push those out as far as they can due to an underlying pressure to perform. While the culture is great at keeping people motivated and happy doing their work, it might be working a little too well.</li>
                  <li>Leadership problems with driving the culture of innovation, speed and discipline</li>
                  <li>They are pushing the forced diversity and inclusion narrative too much and too focused on being social justice warriors.</li>
                  <li>They treat disabled military vets like trash and place them in positions that are even worse for their disability.</li>
                  <li>Culture can lead to people wanting to hide problems o stead owning up to them</li>
                  <li>The IT organization is mismanaged and horrible. Some of the main culture pillars include "customer orientation" and everything in IT goes against that. Nobody has faith when you're told to "go to it.intel.com and submit a ticket" that it's going to be done properly. The system doesn't allow for easy rerouting. It's full of third world support people shoving tickets around, not understanding the issues. Anything above "can you turn it off and on again" type stuff is an absolute joke. This same system is what everyone uses be it "my laptop won't turn on" to a huge advanced IT project's support. The lower tiers have no idea what those things are and usually the ticket is DOA.</li>
                  <li>Still old management culture with bureaucracy</li>
                  <li>Calls coming in from 1am-6am were pretty frequent and they negatively affected my mental state during work.</li>
                  <li>Very unorganized, fear-based culture, messy management</li>
                  <li>an older, more traditional and conservative culture (could be a pro or con depending per person) - lack of diversity in management</li>
                  <li>Terrible company culture -- almost too toxic</li>
                  <li>Beginning to become overly focused on cost and metrics in a way that is detrimental to the culture and employee well being</li>
                  <li>This kind of mentality leads to hiding the truth and creating groups that watch each other’s back. They are known for being very ethical, but the truth is the culture is to hide what isn’t ethical.</li>
                  <li>No Benefits, Long Hours Standing</li>
                  <li>Not a fast paced culture</li>
                  <li>A little laidback culture there.</li>
                  <li>layoffs, management, toxic work culture, etc....</li>
                  <li>Reorganization tends to be frequent as evolution of internal culture continues.</li>
                  <li>Top-down culture is risk adverse -- afraid to invest within to make something truly remarkable, but willing to buy a company off the shelf that did.</li>
                  <li>Diversity hiring quotas will put you at a disadvantage in getting hired if you are male and white or Indian.</li>
                  <li>good salary, benefits, insurance, 401k</li>
                  <li>culture changed gradually since 2005 and get worse after 2010 - focus on lots of fluent talkers fighting for visibility and later diversity (hire/promote persons on gender/color than real merit) - worse time since BK started and after getting Dr. Murthy and gang in</li>
                  <li>Over-index on inclusion may be blunting the strong, direct culture needed to transform and win in new markets.</li>
                  <li>Salary could be better but I prioritize benefits and climate and opportunities for growth</li>
                  <li>low pay, long worked hours, intel culture is not healthy, a lot of stresses and pressure from upper management.</li>
                  <li>Some imported execs are at odds with the long-time Intel culture, but Bob Swan seems to be forcing at least some of them out</li>
                  <li>With the Intel's size and diversity of it's portfolio, beauracacy stifles some innovation and leads to slow movement</li>
                  <li>Some groups at Intel become like gangsters to get admission is to state your loyalty to the manager and their own culture  while the company policy dictate another.</li>
                  <li>Top-heavy resulted in bad work culture. Toxic work culture.</li>

                  <li>Senior and diverse women leave Intel quicker than men - and make the typical ~80% of what like-experienced male peers do.</li>
                  <li>Lack of diversity and integration for new employees</li>
                  <li>Conservative and slow acting culture</li>

                  <li>Lack of clear corporate culture</li>
                  <li>Super aggressive work culture, chaotic environment, confused management, toxic environment overall with low employee morale</li>
                  <li>Work 80hr weeks to be on-call 24/ Worst culture I have ever witnessed.</li>
                  <li>Leadership from other companies have forgotten Intel culture and turned company into those they have left</li>
                  <li>Much internal process, "diversity" is often chosen over meritocracy.</li>
                  <li>Low upward mobility, culture of hypocrisy WRT practice vs preach, mercenary executive leaders with low commitment to long-term, relentless focus on shareholder equity as driving factor for organizational success, lack of clear rollout of vision --> strategy --> execution, constant infighting and struggle for resources creates "scarcity mentality" and "resource hoarding"</li>
                  <li>Aggressive and combative culture.</li>
                  <li>There is lot of racial discrimination in that group.</li>

                  <li>Lack of diversified benefits available</li>
                  <li>Culture has degraded and is unhealthy, no movement upwards for senior employees, poor executive mgmt and leadership for senior employees</li>
                  <li>The workplace culture is toxic, and the job is not as advertised.</li>
                  <li>Intel benefits look good on paper but are not honored by middle management. Intel has a crisis culture that burns people out.</li>

                  <li>Most of us who discuss these challenges are women, yet Intel supposedly has achieved pay equity and met their diversity goals.</li>

                  <li>No transparency, too much politics, ego driven managers, uncountable reorganizations, no scope for growth, hard work doesn't promote you but impressing the manager/management does and none of the company's value applies to the work culture, just a company filled with bunch of old people, waiting for their retirement, making important decisions</li>
                  <li>Salary, incentives and Benefits may not match the industry average.</li>
                  <li>Intel is slowly cutting benefits: no GPTW, no snacks on fridays, 401k matching isn't what it used to be, change RSU allocation to short change you.</li>

                  <li>If you want a great salary and benefits, and can stomach a lot of bureaucracy and being continually told to keep doing more with less, then this is the place for you!</li>
                  <li>Intel HR has been promoting diversity, diversity, and diversity. But, seriously, first day I came to office, I was lost. I though I was working in Bangalore office, not San Diego.   The issue with this is that people often speak their own language at work, which is according to HR is unlawful.  And, how can people who don't belong to this ethnic group can be sure that they are not discriminated at performance review?</li>

                  <li>Accountability from all directions! Not just top-down. Having a good manager is usually down to 'luck', and this can lead to a lot of frustration, career stagnation, lack of acknowledgement, recognition and promotion -which overall affects employee retention rate. There needs to be more management accountability from the bottom up and provide appropriate channels for employees to voice their concerns and be heard  for an effective culture transformation.</li>
                  <li>Hiring culture not open - may cause favarism among certain group of people.</li>

                  <li>The company has deeply ingrained dishonesty in its culture.  If you look at any long term employee who has made at least to middle-management, you can bet they are dishonest and shady. The company, in my opinion, inadvertantly rewards those who lie and hide the truth. There is no straight-talk between senior leadership and the rest. There is no straight talk between the middle-managers to the rest. There is only BS and it is pervasive. Everyone knows this.  The performance review is almost always a complete farce. Seniority is highly prized and political alliances takes top priority. Those who are outside-looking-in will almost definitely get the shaft, irregardless of their actual performance and capabilities. In my opinion, Intel is one of the most dishonest corporate culture I have ever witnessed. It is also racist, and I don't just mean racism from whites to minorities. Reverse racism (H1B Indians against others) is fairly rampant especially in IT. That is too bad because Intel has a virtual monopoly on one of the most important products: the chip that drives virtually every computer today.  For over 30 years, Intel has tried to diversity its product portfolio by pouring tens-billions into its R&D and M&A. Today, Intel has virtually nothing to show for those tens of billions invested outside of its single core product. Why? Its culture is rotten, dishonest, racist, and degenerate and doesn't reward\punish its employees properly.  Intel has been a subject of numerous lawsuits that validates everything I stated above. Again, no one ever says Intel is a culture of straight-talk and honesty...ever.</li>
