                        <li>This attitude has given me so much <b>mental</b> stress that i will not wish that on anyone .</li>
                        <li>"competitive" pay and <b>benefits</b> seem to aim for average; vacation time can be upset by manufacturing and product release cycles; getting things done can be slow and tangled in bureaucracy; significant communication overhead (email, ims, meetings); coordinating across worldwide times zones is painful; difficult to drive change and improvements; lots of meetings and a seeming expectation to be immediately reachable and interruptible when working; regular reorgs; management often seems disconnected from engineers and engineering work; always stretched thin and understaffed despite having so many employees; business decisions often don't make sense; plenty of mediocre coworkers to suffer through</li>
                        <li>Immigrants in non-usa orgs face issues as non- usa teams or leaders are not properly trained professional to address the <b>culture</b> and values of intel.</li>
                        <li>Too slow pacing sometimes, outdated culture</li>
                        <li>Internal struggle between <b>culture</b> warriors can cause the company to lose sight of what it's really good at</li>
                        <li>There should not be bonus kickers that relate to <b>diverse</b> hiring - that is nothing i can control nor should it be there at all. i am not against any <b>diversity</b> or <b>inclusive</b> activities. the other issue i have, and this will not be a popular opinion probably, is that i feel that we have gone too far on <b>diversity</b> and <b>inclusion</b>. go after people that offend vs telling a manager a <b>diverse</b> candidate is the requirement when the non-<b>diverse</b> candidate is clearly the better choice.</li>
                        <li>Learning curve droops fast, not much <b>diversity</b></li>

                        <li>Arrogance permeates throughout their ranks, causing them to ignore customer inputs and have a "build it and they will come" mentality. strong <b>culture</b> of "old boy" network with archaic technical leadership boards serving as the veiled popularity contest judge panel for promoting technical talent.</li>
                        <li>Need to improve <b>benefits</b> and 401k</li>
                        <li>Location, size of the company,onboarding, trainings, <b>benefits</b></li>
                        <li><b>Culture</b>, focus, direction all shake out from this.</li>
                        <li>Less stock <b>benefits</b>.</li>
                        <li>Volatility can be high business direction wise, and as with any company the people in leadership matter and in this case can drive some inconsistencies in the experience and culture.</li>
                        <li>Bureaucratic policies and corporate <b>culture</b> can lead to slow decision times on key issues</li>
                        <li>Need to change work culture to attract more young talent</li>
                        <li>When i started at intel, the <b>culture</b> was very much about ‘meritocracy’ meaning the rewards were based on what you accomplished and the results you achieved.</li>
                        <li>Could have made even larger chips if the <b>culture</b> stays where it used to be</li>
                        <li>Long hours and lack of bonus / additional <b>benefits</b></li>
                        <li>Bad team <b>culture</b> and people</li>
                        <li>Intel usually beats them in <b>benefits</b>, but most younger people don't care about that as much.</li>
                        <li>Dislike company culture, big campus</li>
                        <li>Locations are less desirable due to lack of <b>diversity</b>.</li>
                        <li>Politics, <b>culture</b> not so good.</li>
                        <li>Their <b>diversity</b> numbers look strong for total poc. but the numbers of latinx and african anericans most relevant to legacy of us and <b>discrimination</b> is poor.</li>

                        <li>Not much <b>benefits</b> or motivation</li>
                        <li>Annual review <b>culture</b>, folks are quick to pass the blame if something fell short.</li>
                        <li>While the <b>culture</b> is great at keeping people motivated and happy doing their work, it might be working a little too well. to their credit one of the intel benefits is a sabbatical every four to seven years, but it's common for people to push those out as far as they can due to an underlying pressure to perform.</li>
                        <li>Leadership problems with driving the <b>culture</b> of innovation, speed and discipline</li>
                        <li>They are pushing the forced diversity and inclusion narrative too much and too focused on being social justice warriors.</li>
                        <li>They treat disabled military vets like trash and place them in positions that are even worse for their <b>disability</b>.</li>
                        <li>Culture can lead to people wanting to hide problems o stead owning up to them</li>
                        <li>The it organization is mismanaged and horrible. some of the main culture pillars include "customer orientation" and everything in it goes against that. nobody has faith when you're told to "go to it.intel.com and submit a ticket" that it's going to be done properly. the system doesn't allow for easy rerouting. it's full of third world support people shoving tickets around, not understanding the issues. anything above "can you turn it off and on again" type stuff is an absolute joke. this same system is what everyone uses be it "my laptop won't turn on" to a huge advanced it project's support. the lower tiers have no idea what those things are and usually the ticket is doa.</li>
                        <li>Still old management <b>culture</b> with bureaucracy</li>
                        <li>Calls coming in from 1am-6am were pretty frequent and they negatively affected my mental state during work.</li>
                        <li>Very unorganized, fear-based culture, messy management</li>
                        <li>Lack of diversity in management - an older, more traditional and conservative culture (could be a pro or con depending per person)</li>
                        <li>Terrible company <b>culture</b> -- almost too toxic</li>
                        <li>Beginning to become overly focused on cost and metrics in a way that is detrimental to the culture and employee well being</li>
                        <li>They are known for being very ethical, but the truth is the <b>culture</b> is to hide what isn’t ethical. this kind of mentality leads to hiding the truth and creating groups that watch each other’s back.</li>
                        <li>No <b>benefits</b>, long hours standing</li>
                        <li>Not a fast paced <b>culture</b></li>
                        <li>A little laidback <b>culture</b> there.</li>
                        <li>Layoffs, management, toxic work <b>culture</b>, etc....</li>
                        <li>Reorganization tends to be frequent as evolution of internal <b>culture</b> continues.</li>
                        <li>Top-down <b>culture</b> is risk adverse -- afraid to invest within to make something truly remarkable, but willing to buy a company off the shelf that did.</li>
                        <li><b>Diversity</b> hiring quotas will put you at a disadvantage in getting hired if you are male and white or indian.</li>
                        <li>Good salary, <b>benefits</b>, insurance, 401k</li>
                        <li><b>Culture</b> changed gradually since 2005 and get worse after 2010 - focus on lots of fluent talkers fighting for visibility and later <b>diversity</b> (hire/promote persons on gender/color than real merit) - worse time since bk started and after getting dr. murthy and gang in</li>
                        <li>Over-index on <b>inclusion</b> may be blunting the strong, direct <b>culture</b> needed to transform and win in new markets.</li>
                        <li>Salary could be better but i prioritize <b>benefits</b> and climate and opportunities for growth</li>
                        <li>Low pay, long worked hours, intel <b>culture</b> is not healthy, a lot of stresses and pressure from upper management.</li>
                        <li>Some imported execs are at odds with the long-time intel <b>culture</b>, but bob swan seems to be forcing at least some of them out</li>
                        <li>With the intel's size and <b>diversity</b> of it's portfolio, beauracacy stifles some innovation and leads to slow movement</li>
                        <li>Some groups at intel become like gangsters to get admission is to state your loyalty to the manager and their own <b>culture</b>  while the company policy dictate another.</li>
                        <li>Toxic work <b>culture</b>. top-heavy resulted in bad work <b>culture</b>.</li>
                        <li>Senior and diverse women leave intel quicker than men - and make the typical ~80% of what like-experienced male peers do.</li>
                        <li>Lack of <b>diversity</b> and integration for new employees</li>
                        <li>Conservative and slow acting <b>culture</b></li>
                        <li>Hard driving <b>culture</b>....you're always on from moment you join the organization</li>
                        <li>Lack of racial <b>diversity</b> in finance, non-<b>inclusive</b> behaviors, hr does not have your back (although i believe it is changing under sandra's leadership).</li>

                        <li>Intel has been a subject of numerous lawsuits that validates everything i stated above. again, no one ever says intel is a culture of straight-talk and honesty...ever. that is too bad because intel has a virtual monopoly on one of the most important products: the chip that drives virtually every computer today.  for over 30 years, intel has tried to diversity its product portfolio by pouring tens-billions into its r&d and m&a. today, intel has virtually nothing to show for those tens of billions invested outside of its single core product. why? its culture is rotten, dishonest, racist, and degenerate and doesn't reward\punish its employees properly.  the company has deeply ingrained dishonesty in its culture.  if you look at any long term employee who has made at least to middle-management, you can bet they are dishonest and shady. the company, in my opinion, inadvertantly rewards those who lie and hide the truth. there is no straight-talk between senior leadership and the rest. there is no straight talk between the middle-managers to the rest. there is only bs and it is pervasive. everyone knows this.  in my opinion, intel is one of the most dishonest corporate culture i have ever witnessed. it is also racist, and i don't just mean racism from whites to minorities. reverse racism (h1b indians against others) is fairly rampant especially in it. the performance review is almost always a complete farce. seniority is highly prized and political alliances takes top priority. those who are outside-looking-in will almost definitely get the shaft, irregardless of their actual performance and capabilities.</li>
