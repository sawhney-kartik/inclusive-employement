                      fulfill their career aspirations. We encourage employee connection through our network of Intel
                      Chartered Employee Resource Groups. These groups unite around a significant common affinity or
                      element of their personal identity and are focused on internal and external activities that build
                      an environment of inclusion. Through recruiting, networking, mentoring, resource sharing and
                      sponsored development events, our Employee Resource Groups are an important part of our culture
                      and reinforce that Intel as a great place to work. <br> <br>

                      other benefits available to you such as the new dental option, life insurance, critical illness,
                      and more. We’re offering more choices for dental coverage with a new dental HMO administered by
                      Delta Dental, available to all U.S. blue badge employees and eligible family members. <br> <br>

                      where they can go to get great Mexican food. Being that food is one of my favorite pastimes,

                            </div> Students and new graduates are constantly posing the question, “What can I do to
                      better prepare myself for an interview with Intel ?” I thought it was time we write a post with
                      some specifics, since we are entering a year where we project some heavy hiring in the intern and
                      college graduate space . (For those of you in the experienced space, these tips can be valuable to
                      you as well!) Hopefully some of the insights will help you be prepared and ultimately land your
                      dream ‘gig’ at Intel. I decided I didn’t want to just supply you with MY insights – so I
                      interviewed some of my peers for this post and hope you find their tips to be helpful! <br> <br>

                              <div class="clearfix">

                                </div> In 2004, Intel joined more than 100 other corporations to call for concrete
                          action to promote diversity in the legal profession. That declaration reflected the
                          shared recognition by Intel and our peers that “the legal and business interests of our
                          clients require legal representation that reflects the diversity of our employees, customers
                          and the communities where we do business.” We pledged to “make decisions regarding which
                          law firms represent our companies based in significant part on the diversity performance of
                          the firms” and “to end or limit our relationships with firms whose performance consistently
                          evidences a lack of meaningful interest in being diverse.” We earnestly believed that our
                          call to action would prompt meaningful change in the legal profession and increase the number
                          of women and minority attorneys representing Intel as outside counsel. <br> <br>

                                </div> This build-out represents an investment of approximately $20 billion, which is
                          expected to create over 3,000 permanent high-tech, high-wage jobs; over 3,000 construction
                          jobs; and approximately 15,000 local long-term jobs. Today, Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey and U.S.
                          Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo participated with Intel executives in the announcement.
                          Gelsinger commented: “We are excited to be partnering with the state of Arizona and the Biden
                          administration on incentives that spur this type of domestic investment.” Intel expects to
                          accelerate capital investments beyond Arizona, and Gelsinger said he plans to announce the
                          next phase of capacity expansions in the U.S., Europe and other global locations within the
                          year. <br> <br>
