          <h5> <b> Valuable Leader: </b> Satya Nadella <br> <br>
               <b> Microsoft’s Valuable 500 Commitment: </b> <br>
            The Microsoft mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. This
            includes the over 1 billion people with disabilities around the world. To live our mission, we strive to
            create accessible products, services, websites, and company culture for all. <br> We are taking an integrated
            approach to disability inclusion, embedding four accessibility pillars into the DNA of the company: <br> <br>
            * Culture: Embracing disability to build a culture of inclusion <br>
            * Systems: Systemic inclusion from start to finish <br>
            * Products: Accessibility built into our products, not bolted on <br>
            * Future: Disruptive innovations to change what’s possible for people with disabilities <br> <br>
            There are no limits to what people can achieve when technology reflects the diversity of everyone who uses
            it. Building accessibility into everything we do helps empower everyone, including people with disabilities,
            to achieve more. <br> Want to learn more? Visit us at

                          <li>@ajohnsocyber Erm, look at you now :) So glad you persisted Ann, and shared the story. Sadly I see/hear it a lot. Gotta change those stereotypes of #disability - it’s just part of being human.</li>
                          <li>London. It’s been a blast. Enjoying one more inclusive signed @BBCNews segment before the flight. Wish this was standard across the pond!
