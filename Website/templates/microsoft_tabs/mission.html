            The Microsoft mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. This
            includes the over 1 billion people with disabilities around the world. To live our mission, we strive to
            create accessible products, services, websites, and company culture for all. <br> We are taking an integrated
            approach to disability inclusion, embedding four accessibility pillars into the DNA of the company: <br> <br>
            <li> Culture: Embracing disability to build a culture of inclusion <br> </li>
             <li> Systems: Systemic inclusion from start to finish <br> </li>
             <li> Products: Accessibility built into our products, not bolted on <br> </li>

            There are no limits to what people can achieve when technology reflects the diversity of everyone who uses
            it. Building accessibility into everything we do helps empower everyone, including people with disabilities,
            to achieve more. <br> Want to learn more? Visit us at

                          <li>To clarify this - it's significant that whitehouse website is accessible as launched (this did not happen in 2016). But the 2016-2021 whitehouse website WAS accessible before archived.  Forgive me for any confusion. Lets celebrate that accessibility is included - from the START!</li>
                          <li>The WhiteHouse Website - is accessible again. And now I need tissues. <a href='https://t.co/oThT769APM'>https://t.co/oThT769APM</a></li>

                          -streamtext captions available.. -using Certified Deaf Interpreters
                          -Audio description

                          <li>RT: Accessibility itself IS NOT hard.

                          But, accessibility at scale IS hard.
                          Doing accessibility consistently well IS hard.
                          Accessibility where it hasn't been done before IS hard.
                          Creating a culture that values accessibility IS hard.

                          Don't confuse one with the other.</li>
                          <li>RT: When identifying race in visual descriptions for #blind people, don't skip white. Often I read things like: John, a Black man, stands with Jane, a dark-haired woman. Intentionally or not, it perpetuates racism. Descriptions &amp; antiracism are both needed to improve #accessibility.</li>
                          <li>It’s that time again! Get ready folks - submission deadline for 2021/22 Microsoft Disability Scholarship Fund coming up.

                          When disabled people succeed, what they overcome are societal barriers.

                          Important to acknowledge and reframe in this way if we are to shift perceptions and raise awareness of what really disables people 🚫 🌎</li>

It isn't something put to the side - it's something from within. #DisabilityAdvantage #ADA30 #AreYouIN <a href='https://t.co/kn9PzpJjfv'>https://t.co/kn9PzpJjfv</a></li>
                          <li>RT: Can I retire now and refer everyone to @Microsoft CEO @satyanadella who just told the world accessibility isn't something you do on the side. A full system change is needed and is one of the most empowering, energizing thing for a company. @jennylayfluffy #DisabilityAdvantage</li>

                          <li>Students shouldn't fear immigration status because they need to take classes virtually to stay safe. Especially students with disabilities.

                          “Technology can provide access to information.. essential tool to navigate the current crisis, but without considering #accessibility, it can also disempower”

                          <li>RT: The ONS says women of working age with a disability are roughly 11 times more likely to die of COVID-19 than their peers; 6.5 times for disabled men. Almost 2/3 of all people who've died of the virus in the UK had a disability. <a href='https://t.co/0ieIIz9o5t'>https://t.co/0ieIIz9o5t</a></li>
                          <li>RT: If you use PowerPoint: The Accessibility Checker on PowerPoint is an amazing tool for making sure your materials are accessible to everyone.

                          I actually didn't know about this tool before, so I wanted to pass along the info just in case.

                          <li>My overall mission, is to reduce the stigma around #disability. Technology allows me to live a very full life in a world that was not designed for me.

                          <li>RT: Many disabled people don’t like being called inspiring. Nondisableds often use the word around #disability without a thought. Others genuinely feel moved to take action. You can describe me as inspiring. Go ahead. But I’ll have something to say, too: What are you inspired to do?</li>
                          <li>Announced at WWDC today: @appletv and @applearcade will soon support both the #xboxadaptivecontroller and #xboxelite2wirelesscontroller.

                          He wrote ‘I don’t date disabled people’.

                          His bias. His loss.

                          <li>Having a disability is part of being human. So let’s get the headline right - “it is ok to ‘dump’ someone because they are human?”

                          No, it’s not ok. And it’s not ok to use space to discuss it.

                          <li>Here’s the hard truth.

                          Disability can happen at any time.

                          And blood clots in particular, impact more than you think.
                          - 900k peeps a year!
                          - One person dies every six minutes from a blood clot.

                          Don’t be like me, know the signs.

                          <li>That said, we need to learn how to interact with #disability. I wrote this blog when I was still reeling from the journey, because of how folks interacted with me. Woah there.

                          Please read. Please watch the videos.

                          It really matters.

                          @MicrosoftTeams + AI captions has saved me this last year!

                          I’m able to be honest about my #disability every single day, embrace it. and learn from it. 5/</li>

                          If you're pondering ROI of accessibility, 'how many gamers are disabled' is the wrong question to ask. Estimates of complete &amp; severe hearing loss range from 2% to 5%, some hearing loss is around 15%. Yet 97% of Far Cry New Dawn's players played with subtitles on.</li>
