                            the learning curve by leaning into our employees expertise and by continuing to prioritize

                                </div> Dan Bertholomey awoke in a hospital in June of 2010, four days after a
                          hit-and-run driver almost killed him while he was riding his motorcycle, to the sinking
                          knowledge that he'd lost the use of his right arm and hand.As he lay in his hospital bed,
                          Bertholomey pondered his future. He thought about his daily life and the things he loved to
                          do.How am I going to game again, he wondered? He'd been an avid gamer since age 10, when an
                          original Pong console from Sears magically transformed his family's television set into an
                          electronic playground that he could control. Bertholomey was instantly hooked. He loved the
                          competitiveness of gaming, loved the places it took his imagination.Bertholomey continued
                          gaming into adulthood, playing often with his son and daughter. In 2005, when he was 40,
                          Bertholomey placed sixth on “Madden Nation,” a televised competition of the U.S.'s best
                          “Madden NFL 06” football video game players. For him, gaming wasn't just a hobby, something
                          he did in his spare time. It was a lifestyle.You can't fathom losing something that you love
                          so much,said Bertholomey, 52, who lives in Mesa, Arizona.It's incredibly devastating.
                          Bertholomey began looking for ways to play with one hand. He found someone to hack him a foot
                          pedal that connected to his Xbox, but it didn't work well for him. He eventually taught himself
                          to play with his left hand, but it was awkward and he couldn't play at anywhere near his
                          previous capacity.The solution Bertholomey needed is now a reality — and it has the potential
                          to make gaming accessible to players with disabilities worldwide. The newXbox Adaptive
                          Controllercan be connected to external buttons, switches, joysticks and mounts, giving gamers
                          with a wide range of physical disabilities the ability to customize their setups. The most
                          flexible adaptive controller made by a major gaming company, the device can be used to play
                          Xbox One and Windows 10 PC games and supports Xbox Wireless Controller features such as button
                          remapping.Bertholomey, who is among a select group of gamers who tested the device, said the
                          controller makes it easy to create different setups for various types of games and seamlessly
                          switch between them. Gamers can set up three different gaming profiles on the controller and
                          don't need to reset the device every time they change games, as they sometimes do with modified
                          controllers.The possibilities are endless,he said.There's so much you can do with it. I've
                          been searching for a one-handed controller for years. I'm so grateful to have a product like
                          this. Microsoft is my hero now more than ever.With the new controller, Bertholomey is reviving
                          a dream he'd long shelved, but never quite let go of.I want to compete again in eSports,he
                          said.The future is bright. The future is exciting.<br> <br>

                          adapted to working remotely, we hear from customers that it’s challenging to connect people,
                          particularly outside of their core working groups, to drive culture and communication, and
                          foster knowledge sharing and innovation. <br> <br>

                          fragmented market of services, infrastructure and hundreds of tools, many that go undiscovered
                          and underutilized by employees at the companies that have invested in them.<br> <br>

                          For us to have the permission to ask the world to change, we must change first. We have to
                          embrace the same speed and mindset that we do in anticipating and building for future
                          technological shifts. Each day, we work to bridge the gap between the culture we espouse and
                          our daily lived experience, but we must do more and do it faster. In order to be successful
                          as a business in empowering everyone on the planet, we need to reflect the world we serve.
                          This is our commitment; we have goals and programs to improve representation in all roles and
                          at all levels. We’re investing in the talent pipeline broadly, as we’ve expanded our
                          connections with Historically Black Colleges and Universities. We also have to create
                          an environment where all voices are heard and valued, that’s why inclusion is a core priority
                          for each one of us. I ask each of us to recommit to our shared D&I priority, participate in
                          our inclusion learning programs, use the tools and resources we have shared on becoming an
                          effective ally for others. We have the capabilities to make Microsoft more diverse and

                          sponsored by the Women at Microsoft employee resource group (ERG). The connection was instant.
                          Both Brits had moved to the U.S. to work with Microsoft – Jacky had just joined Microsoft as
                          the vice president of IT Strategic Services, while Jenny had already been with Microsoft since
                          2006 and was moving into a new role with a dedicated focus on driving accessibility. <br> <br>

                                </div> Over 70% of disabilities are invisible. You may not know if someone in your
                          distribution list or team has a disability. When you build and share accessible content, you
                          empower people with disabilities at home, work and school, especially virtual school. As a
                          father of a kindergartener, I see firsthand the challenges remote learning introduces to
                          families. For those with disabilities, both students and parents, there is an additional
                          layer, as every piece of content needs to be accessible. <br> <br>
