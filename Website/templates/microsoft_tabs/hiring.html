                                </div> Around the world, 2020 has emerged as one of the most challenging years in many
                          of our lifetimes. In six months, the world has endured multiple challenges, including a
                          pandemic that has spurred a global economic crisis. As societies reopen, it’s apparent that
                          the economy in July will not be what it was in January. Increasingly, one of the key steps
                          needed to foster a safe and successful economic recovery is expanded access to the digital
                          skills needed to fill new jobs. And one of the keys to a genuinely inclusive recovery are
                          programs to provide easier access to digital skills for people hardest hit by job losses,
                          including those with lower incomes, women, and underrepresented minorities. <br> <br>

                          to build together with employees. This is certainly the case with Microsoft, as we evolve our
                          culture to one that embodies a growth mindset and that embraces diversity and inclusion.<br> <br>

                                </div> Our mission at Microsoft is to empower every person and every organization on the
                          planet to achieve more. That includes the 1+ billion people with disabilities around the world
                          . We believe that people with disabilities are a strength for our company and a talent pool
                          that adds not just diversity but expertise and empathy that make our products, services and
                          culture better. Under this guiding principle, over the last several years we have launched
                          employment programs focused on bringing in the untapped talent of people with disabilities.
                          One of those programs is our Supported Employment program run by our Real Estate and
                          Facilities team. Since the program started, over 270 supplier positions have been filled by
                          external staff with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) on Microsoft campuses
                          globally, and that number is steadily growing. The learnings have been immense and have
                          helped shape our approach to external staffing. We are sharing these learnings with our
                          supplier base of over 30,000 organizations around the world. <br> <br>

                          view. Serving as Director of Supportability in Microsoft’s Accessibility program, she ensures
                          the teams designing Microsoft products and services always consider people with disabilities.
                          She helps engineers understand what does or doesn’t work from an end user’s perspective.
                          Taylor brought her extensive accessibility advocacy experience and knowledge to Microsoft,
                          helping to transform the company’s culture, when she joined in May 2015. During her first year
                          at Microsoft, she became a key member of the Hackathon team that brought Microsoft’sSeeing AI
                          app to market. The app is designed to help people who, like Taylor, are blind, by using their
                          smartphones to describe the world around them. <br> <br>
