There are a half-dozen half-finished Word documents on my laptop, all of them abandoned at some point because I felt like I was failing to express myself. I mean, there’s a lot at stake here. My devotion to the company and what it represents has been such that, despite being a huge linux advocate for most of my coding life, I found myself shifting to everything Microsoft, from browser to IDE to Dev environment, in the last 8 weeks. I have witnessed (in a very virtual first hand fashion) MS software design philosophy, have interacted with its global workforce and experienced its culture. I have seen the massive organisational wheel in action, and witnessed how every single employee plays a part in the system, a system where despite being an intern, you can make a tangible impact with just a laptop and some passion.</li>

              <div class="column">
                <h4>Negative Comments</h4>
                  <li>Benefits standard for tech, but on the lower rungs (retail, employees sub. <60,00 the co-pays can be impactful. Difficult to time tuition reimbursements to "real" college semesters, best to apply yearly instead.</li>
                  <li>Despite positive company culture, not all leaders subscribe to the overall company position on culture</li>
                  <li>some groups are not as nimble as others, job function redundancies can be seen which can lead to job insecurity, D&I value, advancement and promotion can vary from group to group</li>
                  <li>Busy Culture if you want to excel</li>
                  <li>Pay is not as great as some other places, however it more than makes up for that in the great company culture.</li>
                  <li>Benefits aren't quite at the same level as competitors like Google and Facebook, but are still quite good.</li>
                  <li>Culture can be slow/bureaucratic at times</li>
                  <li>Some teams still have horrible culture and no one pays attention</li>
                  <li>As a new employee it's difficult to swim in the Microsoft Culture if you don't have direction and someone helping you meet the "right" people.</li>
                  <li>Pay/benefits not as good as other top software companies</li>
                  <li>tough work culture for new hires</li>
                  <li>It's a big company and that means there's a certain culture and way of doing things.</li>
                  <li>Leadership is very vocal about diversity and inclusion efforts but actual change is very slow.</li>
                  <li>No benefits at this job</li>
                  <li>Pockets of old school msft culture, lots of overhead</li>
                  <li>Diversity, language barriers, weak project direction</li>
                  <li>Politics are worse than any other company I've been at and, despite all the "diversity" focus, women are treated worse than men once they get there, and women are hired in above their experience level which leads to even more "she was only hired because she is a woman" mentality</li>
                  <li>Still issues with diversity and inclusion, they talk about it, but every female I know in the company are struggling with different aspects of cultural issues.</li>
                  <li>Culture has changed - MSFT has become too comfortable - processes and feelings take a priority over winning customers and business.</li>
                  <li>culture is dependent on team</li>
                  <li>The culture of "greater Microsoft" which is what they call corporate, is incredibly downward looking at anybody in the other parts of the organization.</li>
                  <li>Old company but culture is changing.</li>
                  <li>Each team has a separate culture and interview process.</li>
                  <li>Still think that things can move even faster - I have a frame of reference now that I've worked in a smaller company, but other than that, great company, fantastic colleagues and great benefits.</li>
                  <li>Complex organization, D&I has become too aggressive</li>
                  <li>Not all teams are same culture-wise</li>
                  <li>Nothing crazy I am happy with all benefits.</li>
                  <li>Each group had its own culture.</li>
                  <li>We are in the middle of a pandemic and bonuses are not as good as other competitors but the benefits are far more amazing that you don't really worry about much else.</li>
                  <li>Diversity and inclusion is not real, there is only 1 perspective allowed and everyone has to conform.</li>
                  <li>Much of the public-facing culture and values of MS is vapor talk. Behind the curtains things are not quite as open and accepting</li>
                  <li>Living in Seattle area is an adjustment during winter, many re-orgs, culture of “sink or swim”, many people seem burned out by many projects</li>
                  <li>sales roles under constant pressure to perform, diversity candidates have been opportunity for advancement</li>
                  <li>Culture and performance can vary widely across teams in different parts of the company.</li>
                  <li>Large corporate culture, sometimes feels like individuals feel no direct responsibility and thus lose motivation</li>
                  <li>Overall if you are a good human being who likes to contribute and play fair, this company is hell. It's full of liars, cheaters, dirty politics, unfair practices in review and work management. But if you can play politics along with these cheaters, you may not get to do great work and responsibilities but can survive and grow. In sort, Awesome for low quality engineers who like to play poor politics and culture. A lot of politics and lies by almost everyone who can lie(890% of employees) except freshers and few moral folks. Good for those who are unqualified not so good engineers but ok in interviews, don't know much but can blabber in meetings and likes to play dirty lies and politics. I am sure some of the people watching this review will be happy cuz there are lot of thankless liars and political folks dying to earn money and respect even if it comes by deceit. Overall pretty pathetic culture and only good for such politics ridden people. The company still works well only because of few good engineers, the legacy of good old products, copy of new software services like azure as a pure copy of AWS etc and ok ceo who is good at acquisitions, monetization, and politics. Also, managers are ready to invest in extra below average engineers who likes to play their slave than good solid engineers and actually they can survive by creating new issues and redoing same stuff. Who knows what is going on in the code except good engineers, they justify wrong and incorrect things. The services actually suffer a lot of issues and life of engineers becomes hell fixing and monitoring them.</li>
                  <li>Diversity & Equity is not as good as it could be given resources Work Life Balance is not inherent in the culture </li>
                  <li>The culture can be insular.</li>
                  <li>Growth potential tapers off in senior roles, limited turnover, stale culture</li>
                  <li>If you aren't at Redmond you don't get to take full advantage of benefits</li>
                  <li>Microsoft will always hire a junior, unskilled, female or diverse person, over a more skilled, experienced white male.</li>
                  <li>Their diversity commitment is a joke once you see higher levels in the org, all white males with a few token females.</li>
                  <li>Culture and work life balance varies greatly by team</li>
                  <li>stressful teams, diversity, unrespect, mismanagement</li>
                  <li>Culture shift is not as fast as expected</li>
                  <li>Passive aggressive culture very fake</li>
                  <li>diversity numbers could be better</li>
                  <li>Overall company culture not consistent with all teams</li>
                  <li>Politics are frustrating, esp if you are new to the culture</li>
                  <li>Very Political and Diversity is placed above demonstrated skill set</li>
                  <li>Pockets of the company are still very much old Microsoft culture. Diversity and Inclusion seems to be buzz words instead of an actual practices.</li>
                  <li>The amazing Microsoft Culture is still not consistent across different departments.</li>
                  <li>Toxic work culture, slightly less than competitive base pay, does not value product quality</li>
                  <li>Hiring and promotion tied to minority staus in the US but no diversity even thought about in India</li>
                  <li>Very old culture and no progressive decisions</li>
                  <li>Disconnected culture.</li>
                  <li>Diversity focus makes it difficult for white males to continue career growth without leaving.</li>
                  <li>Discrimination issues?</li>
                  <li>Culture varies a lot group to group</li>
                  <li>Lacking strong middle leadership in sales, culture negatively impacted as a result</li>
                  <li>Not as many benefits as I’d imagine</li>
                  <li>Oftentimes things move slowly; easy to get swallowed by "big company culture."</li>
                  <li>Diversity for African-Americans in management positions could be better.</li>
                  <li>Diversity for African-Americans in management positions could be better.</li>
                  <li>Company culture is great but can be a distraction some times.</li>
                  <li>benefits, co-pays, engineers forced into sales</li>
                  <li>Highly political culture and hard to advance.</li>
                  <li>Still a lot of "old boys club" mentality. Culture is hard to change, leaders with new ideas are often moved aside. Predominantly driven by top-down culture.</li>
                  <li>culture could be a bit cut throat and political.</li>
                  <li>As a result, this will likely mean discrimination against others based on skin color.</li>
                  <li>people are not encouraged to be their authentic selves, still very much a know it all culture of fear</li>
                  <li>say they are inclusive but really it ends up that practices are intentionally exclusive of those who don't fit into certain demographics that are publicly acceptable</li>
                  <li>Microsoft's a fantastic place to work if you're raising a family or have been in the industry for a while, and it definitely shows. When HQ is in the suburbs and the workforce is older compared to the rest of big tech, the culture is less "Silicon Valley" and more "comfy employer to work for the rest of your life".</li>
                  <li>Thus, less “real” new and diverse thinkers.</li>
                  <li>Your manager controls your potential career growth; very slow promotion cycle; very homogenous culture; lots of legacy people with outdated mindsets; old school user research methods</li>
                  <li>Culture</li>
                  <li>Culture</li>
                  <li>Benefits can be sligtly better</li>
                  <li>D&I</li>
                  <li>Bad management and not enough benefits</li>
                  <li>Lack of better diversity and inclusion</li>
                  <li>Movement inside the company is not easy. Especially, Principal engineers have extra diversity based rules - which reduces the available options from an already reduced set. Rewards and Compensation model - almost incentivizes people to not share information and work in isolation. This has a huge negative impact on the Culture. Culture in many teams is close to Toxic. </li>
                  <li>company culture could use work</li>
                  <li>A slow pace work culture</li>
                  <li>To focused on diversity and not enough on qualifications.</li>
                  <li>people oriented around a sales culture may disappointed</li>
                  <li>the culture is tough to deal with</li>
                  <li>Bad benefits for contractors, hackers</li>
                  <li>I wish there was a bit more diversity.</li>
                  <li>Diversity is also a con. Most senior tech leaders are men. The way of doing work is very aggressive, so the women that do make it that far are usually not very likeable.</li>
                  <li>Trying to navigate the new diversity initiatives without causing inequities</li>
                  <li>Very limited opportunity for advancement unless you're a diversity hire</li>
                  <li>Sometimes times they over optimize for diversity and inclusion</li>
                  <li>Ineffective middle management and a culture of siloed organizations</li>
                  <li>Great benefits, but hard to continue to level up in role (4 years seems common).</li>
                  <li>Benefits good but not as amazing as they used to be</li>
                  <li>slow culture, slow career progression</li>
                  <li>Culture is trending bad in CO+I</li>
                  <li>Culture is trending bad in CO+I</li>
                  <li>As every large corporation, Microsoft still needs to focus on diversity and inclusion a little bit more.</li>
                  <li>culture varies by team; slow to make decisions as with any corporation</li>
                  <li>Long Hours; emphasis on "diversity" creating reduction in meritocracy</li>
                  <li>Culture, politics are insane, competitive</li>
                  <li>Some of this can be attributed to lack of diversity. For example, if an org is 890% a specific race/culture, it's more likely you'll be met with huge cultural and generational differences and individuals/managers who perpetuate bias and stereotypes.</li>
                  <li>As much as company speaks about work life balance, women empowerment, diversity etc..it all really depends on the team and manager. Hard to navigate your way out in a toxic culture</li>
                  <li>strict deadlines, forced diversity training</li>
                  <li>There's a lot of lip service to caring about mental health.</li>
                  <li>still have work to do to continue to grow their diversity within their organization</li>
                  <li>Some of the "old guard" middle mgmt has negative culture behaviors</li>
                  <li>Limited growth prospects, not great culture</li>
                  <li>Culture can be toxic, lip service to better culturr</li>
                  <li>Culture of people in NYC.</li>
                  <li>Not the most diverse</li>
                  <li>Rather top down culture.</li>
                  <li>Microsoft is driven from the top-down culture, nothing bubbles up unless your managers do it for you (and they're too scared to disagree with VPs) - "Yes" culture and lying in Azure. Facades and half baked solutions because everything is rushed to simply get the MVP to answer "yes". You will find your managers and developers lying ALL the time to look better on the surface. - Nepotism & bro culture - They pretend that they are fixing this issue but you will still find a significant amount of teams that only hire the same race and gender (generally men). These teams have been around for over 5 years and they have no interest in changing that dynamic.</li>
                  <li>The benefits are not great</li>
                  <li>little exposure to office community/culture while on contract and visible hierarchy between contractors and FTEs who maintain identical roles and responsibilities</li>
                  <li>Many layers of management complexity, culture is skin deep and designed more for external perception than internal growth</li>
                  <li>Culture is employee friendly, keeps innovating in the wrong ways.</li>
                  <li>Long way to go to stamp old culture's politics</li>
                  <li>Culture</li>
                  <li>very bureaucratic, odd compensation and measurement system, too internally focused, not a good sales culture</li>
                  <li>Ofcourse, most of the pros and cons will vary from team to team except of things like salary and benefits.</li>
                  <li>Career growth can be a challenge, old rewards culture (not good) still lurks around the corner</li>
                  <li>No pet benefits, no time to enjoy benefits, poor managers</li>
                  <li>D&I is generally good, but it can get a little silly sometimes/group think.</li>
                  <li>High paced, high stress and the culture</li>
                  <li>no work-life culture at all</li>
                  <li>Still not diverse enough.</li>
                  <li>benefits not upto the market standard</li>
                  <li>lack of growth opportunities, location, diversity in leadership</li>
                  <li>lack of growth opportunities, location, diversity in leadership</li>
                  <li>There is not much of a culture in the office on the east coast.</li>
                  <li>Discrimination during appraisals and yearly reviews</li>
                  <li>Discrimination during appraisals and yearly reviews</li>
                  <li>If culture and inclusion are important to you, avoid Microsoft for now. If this doesn't matter, welcome on board. There is a layer of management that has been here for 15+ AND is entrenched in a 'good old boys' culture. If you tow the line and kiss the ring you will be fine. Your good ideas are theirs and your bad ones are yours. </li>
                  <li>HR Has weaponized Inclusiveness and Diversity to mean, "white men please leave".  And there's a heightened culture of victims in waiting.  The statement "everyone has a personal truth" means you can get in trouble for anything.  There are even policies about words and phrases to use that HR wants you to use, but if those preferred words and phrases offend someone you are in trouble.  And there are quiet talks by managers about how the rules are different for white men.  One message is that if a white man sees someone of another category harassing or intimidating someone, they aren't allowed to report.   </li>
                  <li>Some people are set in their ways and not yet participating in the inclusive culture.</li>
                  <li>Poor process, toxic PM culture, lethargy, TC is half of competitors</li>
                  <li>Some of the cork culture is toxic</li>
                  <li>Political culture, slow promotion timeline</li>
                  <li>Absolutely leaderless and more concerned around talking about diversity than actually thinking about customers.</li>
                  <li>Management culture is quite hierarchical and decisions are made very top-down.</li>
                  <li>Diversity and Inclusion are great, but are being misused and weaponized unfortunately at all levels.</li>
                  <li>Still not a good place for introverts...although the culture is evolving - Mid level leaders haven´t adjusted to the new culture, so they are causing employee sat issues and churn</li>
                  <li>Very hard to navigate culture.</li>
                  <li>They're also all from the PNW and seem to have trouble with people with having individuals from other parts of the world, resulting in an incredibly insular and ignorant culture.</li>
                  <li>While Satya has worked to change the culture to be more diverse and inclusive, there are still pockets where speaking up to challenge status quo are still frowned on.</li>
                  <li>Lots of petty politics remain in the culture; very hierarchical</li>
                  <li>average pay and benefits aren't as competitive as other companies in the area</li>
                  <li>But I think this more to do with the size of the company than a particular culture.</li>
                  <li>Need to work out there culture.</li>
                  <li>Historically engineering-first, feature-driven work culture; extra effort for designers to do some convincing on behalf of the end users...</li>
                  <li>Need to be in right team to reap the benefits of the company</li>
                  <li>company struggles operationally for continuous improvement - culture of heroes</li>
                  <li>Overly PC - Diversity was valued as long as it met their definition of diversity.  True diversity of values was not valued unless your values met their values.</li>
                  <li>Sporadic middle management, Diversity misalignment</li>
                  <li>Work-life balance can be challenging but Microsoft is flexible and accommodating.</li>
                  <li>Politics, Culture isn't strong outside of HQ, Sales Quotas are often very unrealistic</li>
                  <li>The culture and work schedule / demand will take up most if not all of your time. This is a highly competitive place and demands all your attention and energy, which in turn can cause lot of stress.  As long as you can work hard to get the great review, this will be a good place for you.  You should plan to leave as soon as you realize that you are not able to keep up with the demand.</li>
                  <li>The turn over in Services is horrendous is due in part to this culture of harassment.</li>

                  <li>While it's actively being talked about and worked on, there is a bit of a legacy culture with the older teams.</li>
                  <li>All male leadership, not investment in D&I, no action on HR issues. </li>
                  <li>Local top leadership is expecting blind loyalty and obedience, and will burn you out if you don't.</li>
                  <li>Strong power-over hierarchy in the management structure that continues to require employees to be constantly people-pleasing to their leaders in order to succeed, despite all the work to improve the culture.</li>
                  <li>Lack of diversity in technical roles</li>
                  <li>Tendency to jump on the latest bandwagon - product, culture, management mantra</li>
                  <li>a long way to go on inclusive culture, including allowing for different career objectives and encouraging employees to change over time</li>
                  <li>Culture in field less "team-centered"</li>
                  <li>toxic culture overall.</li>
                  <li>Senior lower management have not embraced culture shift</li>
                  <li>Rabid focus on diversity creates reverse discrimination.</li>
                  <li>Groupism, still some folks in management who are in old culture</li>
                  <li>still has large pockets of the 'good ol boy' male domination mentality - lacks modern day diversity in many senior but not corporate leaders</li>
                  <li>Not excellent culture.</li>
                  <li>Pay and benefits are great, but a bit less than leading competitors.</li>
                  <li>Slow to change and not diverse enough.</li>
                  <li>IE they have never changed their ways to be more inclusive and they never will.</li>
                  <li>IE they have never changed their ways to be more inclusive and they never will.</li>
                  <li>There are no repercussions for managers harrassing their employees, or directly discriminating against them. Admin culture doesn't align with the culture Microsoft preaches.</li>
                  <li>Strong diversity and inclusion bias forming across the company which can be extremely negative for some people.</li>
                  <li>Take diversity to an extreme</li>
                  <li>The company doesn't value designers (though this culture is slowly changing)</li>
                  <li>Satya did a good job on the image of the company, however when you are inside, many things are the same. Diversity and inclusion is a joke. Most upper mid-level management (some M2s, most directors, DEs, junior VPs) resist to change, so organizations, ICs, M1s get stuck in between.</li>
                  <li>each team has their own culture and management strategy.</li>
                  <li>Culture re-alignment not spreading across the organization.</li>
                  <li>My old GM was reported multiple times for discrimination and yet he is still there. here is a culture change happening but there are still a lot of the Ballmer era people around collecting enormous paychecks.</li>
                  <li>Long hours, need a strong commitment, need to be able to deal with ambiguity as the culture changes and grows.</li>
                  <li>Culture change isn't nearly as far along as you might think: still a lot of pockets of toxicity.</li>
                  <li>Ungodly amount of favoritism, SJW culture, Bad management, Moving forward is difficult</li>
                  <li>Yes - MICROSOFT is obsessed with diversity but this also means that often the best qualified person didn’t get the job.</li>
                  <li>24/7 on-call duty added after hire with no extra compensation or accommodation.</li>
                  <li>gender disparity , stop learning, too little diversity</li>
                  <li>More talk than walk about transparency and diversity Pervasive water cooler (gossip, Blind) atmosphere </li>
                  <li>High salary discrimination</li>
                  <li>Some old Microsoft habits and culture linger on</li>
                  <li>Pockets of the company still seem to not be reading the culture change memos.</li>
                  <li>I hear the engineering teams' culture is awful.</li>
                  <li>Hard to write that in a way that doesn't sound like a troll, which I'm not, but after years of observation, I don't see a better way to put that - there are no second chances for non-diverse people, so don't screw up. MS is trying to 'solve' diversity & inclusion very aggressively, which is important but unfortunately means that some really great people who don't meet D+I criteria aren't recognized or rewarded at the level they should be (as in, rewards are moved down to free up money for diverse but less effective people), and non-diverse employees are shown the door QUICKLY to make room for … others.</li>
                  <li>Microsoft has had a long culture of hiring male bullies. Now MS is putting a lot of marketing $ into "changing the culture" and their so-called commitment to diversity and inclusion.</li>
                  <li>Company culture is a challenge</li>
                  <li>Culture, lack of accountability within teams.</li>
                  <li>) No diversity. Don't let the rah rah talks fool you. This company doesn't care about promoting women or ethnicities, which is why there's been so many lawsuits. Luckily this company has lots and lots of lawyers to fend off all of these lawsuits.</li>
                  <li>Big gap in culture between people in the Redmond area vs people in Cambridge.</li>
                  <li>Also your experience is hugely, hugely team dependent. Local team culture matters way more than anything that happens at top management level. Two employees at two different teams can have drastically different lives. Maybe the things I list as pros are actually cons in your team, and vice versa. Unfortunately there's no real way to tell what it'll be like working on a team until you actually start working there. You can gauge the number of young vs old developers to get a sense of the culture though. The annual review system, which invariably involves peer feedback and encourages backstabbing peers, can be maddening. Even after spending several years here, most people will find it's hard to break off of the railroaded promotion system and really shine as a superstar, just due to the seniority-based culture and siloed nature of the work (you don't have the expertise to move into a management role or more technical area that's already being done by someone more senior, but by never doing that role you'll never build expertise).</li>
                  <li>Overindexing on inclusion/diversity that is taking a toll on productivity.</li>
                  <li>Inclusive is a word that is used by CEO and all leaders repeat the same.</li>
                  <li>Overall, the organization is filled with gossipy, rest and vest types. I also witnessed a very bright young African American female employee verbally abused and viciously bullied by her manager while senior leaders turned a blind eye. For all of you out there, I would think long and hard before joining the HR function at Microsoft.  Don’t say that you weren’t warned.</li>
                  <li>There's a bit of kool-aide in that they talk about your "Career at Microsoft", however it is very rare that skilled individuals move up in the store. Promotions and raises seem to be based on diversity hiring tactics and favoritism rather than merit, ability, and professionalism foremost.</li>
                  <li>diversity is causing challenges for personal growth</li>
                  <li>This is not a new trend but now a unwritten one where Women are given the promotion in order to show the world they do not discriminate. The company has to hire women as they have to show that they are not discriminating.</li>
                  <li>It is worth asking about micro-culture details when joining to see how they align with your likes.</li>
                  <li>Also, not-invented-here culture is still pretty strong.</li>
                  <li>larger groups struggle and continue to support the old guard culture.</li>
                  <li>Lack of diversity in management roles and "boys club" management ranks.</li>
                  <li>Discrimination of women and minorities</li>
                  <li>Discrimination of women and minorities</li>
                  <li>Design culture needs to pick up</li>
                  <li>culture stack ranking is toxic</li>
                  <li>old tech stack, backstabbing culture, less promotion and famous for low ball and underpay</li>
                  <li>This means that you mileage may vary with respect to job satisfaction, depending on whether your group culture suits you. The culture of different groups within Microsoft varies markedly.</li>
                  <li>part of the liberal bubble, too focused on hitting diversity quotas to the detriment of hiring the best candidate for the position</li>
                  <li>Politics, back stabbing, lack of diversity, retaliation, discrimination</li>
                  <li>Culture is stuffy and traditional</li>
                  <li>Be warned, the culture empowers people in power to rape, HR will protect them, what they preach is all smoke and mirrors.</li>
                  <li>Disorganized, mind-numbingly focused on trivial things, stagnant culture</li>
                  <li>Culture is pretty old.</li>
                  <li>The old-school top-down micro-managy culture has not gone away yet.</li>
                  <li>It is not a great culture</li>
                  <li>The company's unique culture began to slowly die after Bill Gates stepped away.</li>
                  <li>Conversations are not inclusive, and communication is bad. When you are unfairly treated, there is no place for your voice to be heard or for you to be understood. If you try to explain, you will be regarded as too defensive and not willing to embrace the growth mindset. When there's misunderstandings, basically my manager told me to shut up in a polite way. I also have been shut down multiple times by senior employees when I tried to help them understand things on a project. Politics or clique is a big issue at the company. The CEO is trying to change the company culture. However, you will find strong resistance to the change from many long-time employees. Some people managers are so fake and pretend to care about you. Instead, they will manipulate and twist messages to guard their jobs and step on your head for promotion. Backstabbing is common to benefit one's own career development. </li>
                  <li>Political culture, work life balance can be hard</li>
                  <li>Team culture might not be aligned with company-wide culture</li>
                  <li>The work culture at MSFT is brilliant.</li>
                  <li>Culture experience is very dependent on which team you join</li>
                  <li>Still the culture has to change in few orgs</li>
                  <li>Culture needs much more work specially at new sites!</li>
                  <li>Middle management are disconnected from the company culture and reality.</li>
                  <li>But Microsoft benefits are one of the best out there</li>

                  <li>Heavily opting the BROs culture! - No HR, no rules protecting your rights and benefits when you leave, and labor law allows company shifted type of contract against the Non-FTEs.</li>
                  <li>Some of the corporate culture doesn't fit the office culture.</li>
                  <li>Work culture within immediate team can vary wildly across organisation - it can be very, very good or quite bad.</li>
                  <li>It is difficult to get promoted due to different diversity policies, for example you cannot be promoted to the senior level because team/group have to keep the balance of the female and male employer at the same level.</li>
                  <li>Limited flexibility when it comes to pay / benefits.</li>

                  <li>c. They are incorrect collaborators in suit and coat. Most of the folks have been somehow caught warned when trying to take advantage of their diversity subordinate.  All of us need to work 200% to make up for their diversity counterparts. I have also worked and managed many diversity who are real gems. Some of them colleagues are extremely talented, with high aspirations. But the other half need the pass to get promoted, get hike and survive. d. They will only encourage diversity colleagues that’s HR policy</li>

                  <li>There is no ethics or any culture change, it is just illusion. Anyone expressing discontent is discovered and they are out sooner or later in one way or the other. Excuses like "fuelling personal growth" and "culture of learning" and "growth mindset" or "I am concerned about you" are for naive people to be trapped in saying their opinion.</li>
                  <li>I felt culture got diluted with so many org & team changes somehow employee empathy was lost somewhere However, working at Microsoft has more advantages than most other software companies, and I'm not talking about just pay.</li>

                  <li>Not inclusive, Finance management sucks.</li>

                  <li>Every project here is a burning project, I don't know what's wrong with the management. People here are very frustrated and annoyed because of the culture they hold. This really sucks.</li>

                  <li>Satya is trying to change the culture for good but old managers are spoiling any effort in IDC with their wicked mentality.</li>
                  <li>Satya’s culture does not cascade down to Latin America.</li>
                  <li>They like to focus on improving the culture and everything around it.</li>

                  <li>No culture of appreciation and constant feedback</li>
                  <li>Unless you diversify your MEA team, the message is that you do not know what is MEA, and Diversity will not be more than a word in a "my top of mind" email, and the good ones will continue to leave MEA.</li>
                  <li>Micro management,  Benefits, progression,  Data centre culture, politics</li>
                  <li>Cross boundaries culture not open</li>
                  <li> Diversity and representation from Africa could be better</li>
                  <li>The overall package and lack of support in confusing benefits does not appeal.</li>
                  <li>IDC doesn't have the great culture that's present in Redmond under Nadella. Office teams in general have much more politics compared to Azure and Bing. But Office Exchange team is in next level. They selected managers and director with zero managerial experience who are always complaining and shouting in meetings.</li>
                  <li>Corporate-like career, everyone advances at the same pace, with little considerations of abilities</li>
                  <li>Corporate-like career, everyone advances at the same pace, with little considerations of abilities</li>
                  <li>Discrimination based on the language spoken As a new hire at a low level, I was discriminated against assigning worthy work. I'm guessing it is easy for them to justify the discrimination citing my level. No promotions for the same reason.</li>
                  <li>The culture in the different Microsoft subsidiaries varies tremendously between the different geographies - some embrace the overall corporate culture and some reflect a more local culture. I switched between the UK and APAC and although it was an amazing experience in hindsight, the company did not prepare me for this in any way.</li>
                  <li>Lot of politics that includes lying and intetional misrepresentation of the truth. Very toxic culture that sucks the life out of you immediately.</li>
                  <li>Lastly I want to highlight I saw a lot of poor treatment of people by management while HR turned a blind eye. Hiring of people in roles that were already filled by other people. Being told one day you are performing well, then the next day being pulled into HR meetings to say you were not meeting expectations. Roles are being downgraded by 2 levels forcing people to leave so management can hire their friends. Or worst yet people made redundant one week and two weeks later asked to come back. No one knows where they stand all while the numbers are crashing. The Australian sub has gone through a terrible change over 2019 and needs a good shake up, the culture is like IBM in the 90s or like a chapter written by Jack Welch. Back stabbing, lack of transparency, a lot of insecure people who throw others under a bus to save themselves and I am talking about the leadership teams.</li>
                  <li>Poor regional leadership and culture... corruption and brown-nosing are more important that competence</li>
                  <li>The culture & mindset is stuck 30 years ago.</li>
                  <li>Culture: Lack of ownership</li>
                  <li>Not unexpected from a PM, but culture of monthly Leadership reviews leads to too much randomisation and churn without much movement on the ground.</li>
                  <li>D&I gone mad: Before I start, I 100% believe in workplace equality - equal opportunities for men and women of any race. That said, even though 20% of Computer Science Grads are Female, Microsoft's push for 50% of senior staff being female and will "positively discriminate" for roles. In talking to managers you are often given the heads-up not to apply for a role as this needs to be a female hire. This has gone so far that there are rumours that senior male execs being offered large packages to 'voluntarily' exit. Also when restructuring rounds go around, it is very rare for females to be considered, meaning male job security is lower than females. </li>
                  <li>Hard to transition over to corporate,not ALL benefits are accessible to part timers (eg.</li>
                  <li>Not much Monetary benefits as compared to other product based companies</li>
                  <li>No documentation culture. Learning curve in terms of the company culture is steep.</li>
                  <li> Culture of managing up  Subjective discrimination</li>
                  <li>Long timers in the company are spoiling the culture</li>
                  <li>No diversity in Japan office.</li>
                  <li>Some teams have a more competitive culture, rather than collaborative.</li>
                  <li>Slow hiring process, diversity over professionalism, lightly terminate contracts.</li>
                  <li>Employee Engagement & friendliness, Organisation culture</li>
                  <li>Culture of CEO - not necessarily experienced at local level</li>
                  <li> Sometimes team culture & personal/career growth depends on your manager, just like elsewhere.</li>
                  <li>Everything. Lower management is terrible, upper management even worse. They don't give a damn about people. Only money and work is important. Forget about good bonuses if you don't agree to work like 60 hours a week - excelling at your job in normal work hours is not enough for good bonus or a promotion. People who agree to do that are praised by managers and put on the pedestal, ruining the work culture.</li>
                  <li>Contingency Staff are not well funded comparing to FTEs nor have good benefits even though they might be better than FTEs, but in general they have salaries better than the other companies.</li>
                  <li>Culture is not really good</li>
                  <li>salary, culture, work life balance</li>
                  <li>Alpha male culture where collaboration is often biased by the opinion of those that are louder</li>
                  <li>On top of it, they are encouraging groupisim which is  changing the work culture.</li>
                  <li>The leadership talks about diversity but its all straight white men which, worse of it all, have been at Microsoft FOR EVER, so they have no clue how to really apply culture change. They dont even know what an innovative culture looks like and that includes the poster boy, Satya, who is the most hierarchical, corporate of them all, despite his "family" story which has been totally overrated.</li>
                  <li>If you’re ambitious and want to make a difference or grow in your career, don’t come here. You’ll be frustrated and pushing constantly uphill. Whilst the growth mindset is preached, it’s not the reality. The culture doesn’t support it, the reporting lines don’t support it and least of all, management doesn’t support it.</li>
                  <li>Overly focused on diversity to the point where it seems almost biased...</li>
                  <li>Startup like culture cannot be experienced</li>
                  <li>Startup like culture cannot be experienced</li>
                  <li>Team upper management culture varies wildly, which can make moves unpredicatable</li>
                  <li>The local company culture is insane - at some point, you will be regularly working illegal amounts of overtime, working while sick, working over weekends or working at night and asking yourself why did you even come here.</li>
                  <li>WOMEN (exploring new opportunities), please stay away from this place. Your struggles are unique. Its your hard earned career. Do not spoil it.  The place is not diversity ready yet (for the women's wing) and will take a few years too for it. You will not receive satisfactory support and will be on your own here. Polluted culture. Very unfriendly. A shocker for anyone stepping in from outside world.</li>

                  <li>extremely toxic culture overall</li>
                  <li>If you have a bad manager, you are basically screwed. It's hierarchical and hard to get promoted so make sure you get in on a good level. You have to stay visible and do lots of aside projects or have great clients to be awarded. Not enough diversity in local subs. Lots of "broken" systems and many reporting channels. It's a djungle when you are new hired. Lots of "unnecessary" work only for others to view and check a box.</li>
                  <li>Lots of people are now London or UK based and the culture in the office has been lost as more and more people work remotely.</li>
                  <li>Inclusion, respect are words we write in our appraisals and put on our event hoardings for better PR.</li>
                  <li>Good culture, values gets diluted at the bottom of the pyramid.</li>

                  <li>There are managers misaligned with the culture of organization looking for the result at the expense of the individual and the work climate.</li>
                  <li>Bit of a IBM club being formed this has has (-) impact on the culture</li>
                  <li>People working overnight and destroy the work environment get all benefits and recognition, people genuinely working with proper timings despite completing all the work, do not get any recognition or credits.</li>
                  <li>Culture can make you unaware of your stress</li>
                  <li>Good flexibility over things like working at home, but slow to adopt part time and job sharing for real flexibility and diversity.</li>
                  <li>Culture and survival within the machine is often a challenge. It's a dangerous and difficult combination if your manager has this mentality. Sadly though, the culture has shifted over the years to encourage and reward this behaviour.</li>
                  <li>Subsidiary has its own way of culture...</li>
                  <li>Not many cultural benefits and progress</li>

                  <li>Culture </li>
                  <li>Really strange/bad atmosphere, extreme competition amongst employees in the same team (not the good kind, the kind where you'd rather not come to work in the morning; seems like a deliberate management methodology), people generally superficial, self-centered and arrogant, I think they deliberately hire malignant narcissists into directorate and higher management positions to keep up that toxic culture (seems to be working in one way or another).</li>
