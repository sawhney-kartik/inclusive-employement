                        <li>Politics are worse than any other company i've been at and, despite all the "<b>diversity</b>" focus, women are treated worse than men once they get there, and women are hired in above their experience level which leads to even more "she was only hired because she is a woman" mentality</li>

                        <li>Each team has a separate <b>culture</b> and interview process.</li>

                        <li><b>Diversity</b> and <b>inclusion</b> is not real, there is only 1 perspective allowed and everyone has to conform.</li>
                        <li>Much of the public-facing culture and values of ms is vapor talk. behind the curtains things are not quite as open and accepting</li>
                        <li>Living in seattle area is an adjustment during winter, many re-orgs, <b>culture</b> of “sink or swim”, many people seem burned out by many projects</li>
                        <li>Sales roles under constant pressure to perform, diversity candidates have been opportunity for advancement</li>
                        <li><b>Culture</b> and performance can vary widely across teams in different parts of the company.</li>
                        <li>Large corporate culture, sometimes feels like individuals feel no direct responsibility and thus lose motivation</li>
                        <li>A lot of politics and lies by almost everyone who can lie(890% of employees) except freshers and few moral folks. good for those who are unqualified not so good engineers but ok in interviews, don't know much but can blabber in meetings and likes to play dirty lies and politics. i am sure some of the people watching this review will be happy cuz there are lot of thankless liars and political folks dying to earn money and respect even if it comes by deceit. overall pretty pathetic <b>culture</b> and only good for such politics ridden people. the company still works well only because of few good engineers, the legacy of good old products, copy of new software services like azure as a pure copy of aws etc and ok ceo who is good at acquisitions, monetization, and politics. also, managers are ready to invest in extra below average engineers who likes to play their slave than good solid engineers and actually they can survive by creating new issues and redoing same stuff. who knows what is going on in the code except good engineers, they justify wrong and incorrect things. the services actually suffer a lot of issues and life of engineers becomes hell fixing and monitoring them. overall if you are a good human being who likes to contribute and play fair, this company is hell. it's full of liars, cheaters, dirty politics, unfair practices in review and work management. but if you can play politics along with these cheaters, you may not get to do great work and responsibilities but can survive and grow. in sort, awesome for low quality engineers who like to play poor politics and <b>culture</b>.</li>
                        <li>Diversity & equity is not as good as it could be given resources work life balance is not inherent in the culture </li>
                        <li>The <b>culture</b> can be insular.</li>
                        <li>Growth potential tapers off in senior roles, limited turnover, stale culture</li>

                        <li>Microsoft will always hire a junior, unskilled, female or <b>diverse</b> person, over a more skilled, experienced white male.</li>
                        <li>Their <b>diversity</b> commitment is a joke once you see higher levels in the org, all white males with a few token females.</li>
                        <li>Culture and work life balance varies greatly by team</li>
                        <li>Stressful teams, <b>diversity</b>, unrespect, mismanagement</li>

                        <li>Overall company culture not consistent with all teams</li>

                        <li>Very political and diversity is placed above demonstrated skill set</li>
                        <li>Pockets of the company are still very much old microsoft culture. diversity and inclusion seems to be buzz words instead of an actual practices.</li>
                        <li>The amazing microsoft <b>culture</b> is still not consistent across different departments.</li>
                        <li>Toxic work culture, slightly less than competitive base pay, does not value product quality</li>
                        <li>Hiring and promotion tied to minority staus in the us but no <b>diversity</b> even thought about in india</li>
                        <li>Very old <b>culture</b> and no progressive decisions</li>
                        <li>Disconnected culture.</li>
                        <li><b>Diversity</b> focus makes it difficult for white males to continue career growth without leaving.</li>

                        <li>Culture varies a lot group to group</li>
                        <li>Lacking strong middle leadership in sales, <b>culture</b> negatively impacted as a result</li>
                        <li>Not as many <b>benefits</b> as i’d imagine</li>
                        <li>Oftentimes things move slowly; easy to get swallowed by "big company culture."</li>
                        <li>Diversity for african-americans in management positions could be better.</li>
                        <li>Company culture is great but can be a distraction some times.</li>
                        <li><b>Benefits</b>, co-pays, engineers forced into sales</li>
                        <li>Highly political <b>culture</b> and hard to advance.</li>
                        <li>Predominantly driven by top-down <b>culture</b>. still a lot of "old boys club" mentality. <b>culture</b> is hard to change, leaders with new ideas are often moved aside.</li>
                        <li><b>Culture</b> could be a bit cut throat and political.</li>
                        <li>As a result, this will likely mean discrimination against others based on skin color.</li>
                        <li>People are not encouraged to be their authentic selves, still very much a know it all <b>culture</b> of fear</li>
                        <li>Say they are <b>inclusive</b> but really it ends up that practices are intentionally exclusive of those who don't fit into certain demographics that are publicly acceptable</li>
                        <li>Microsoft's a fantastic place to work if you're raising a family or have been in the industry for a while, and it definitely shows. when hq is in the suburbs and the workforce is older compared to the rest of big tech, the culture is less "silicon valley" and more "comfy employer to work for the rest of your life".</li>
                        <li>Thus, less “real” new and <b>diverse</b> thinkers.</li>
                        <li>Your manager controls your potential career growth; very slow promotion cycle; very homogenous culture; lots of legacy people with outdated mindsets; old school user research methods</li>
                        <li>Culture</li>
                        <li><b>Benefits</b> can be sligtly better</li>
                        <li><b>D&i</b></li>
                        <li>Bad management and not enough <b>benefits</b></li>
                        <li>Lack of better diversity and inclusion</li>
                        <li>Rewards and compensation model - almost incentivizes people to not share information and work in isolation. this has a huge negative impact on the culture. culture in many teams is close to toxic.  movement inside the company is not easy. especially, principal engineers have extra diversity based rules - which reduces the available options from an already reduced set.</li>
                        <li>Company culture could use work</li>
                        <li>A slow pace work <b>culture</b></li>
                        <li>To focused on <b>diversity</b> and not enough on qualifications.</li>
                        <li>People oriented around a sales <b>culture</b> may disappointed</li>
                        <li>The <b>culture</b> is tough to deal with</li>
                        <li>Bad <b>benefits</b> for contractors, hackers</li>
                        <li>I wish there was a bit more <b>diversity</b>.</li>
                        <li>Diversity is also a con. most senior tech leaders are men. the way of doing work is very aggressive, so the women that do make it that far are usually not very likeable.</li>
                        <li>Trying to navigate the new diversity initiatives without causing inequities</li>
                        <li>Very limited opportunity for advancement unless you're a <b>diversity</b> hire</li>
                        <li>Sometimes times they over optimize for <b>diversity</b> and <b>inclusion</b></li>
                        <li>Ineffective middle management and a <b>culture</b> of siloed organizations</li>
                        <li>Great <b>benefits</b>, but hard to continue to level up in role (4 years seems common).</li>
                        <li>Benefits good but not as amazing as they used to be</li>
                        <li>Slow <b>culture</b>, slow career progression</li>
                        <li><b>Culture</b> is trending bad in co+i</li>
                        <li>As every large corporation, microsoft still needs to focus on <b>diversity</b> and <b>inclusion</b> a little bit more.</li>
                        <li><b>Culture</b> varies by team; slow to make decisions as with any corporation</li>
                        <li>Long hours; emphasis on "<b>diversity</b>" creating reduction in meritocracy</li>
                        <li>Culture, politics are insane, competitive</li>
                        <li>Some of this can be attributed to lack of diversity. for example, if an org is 890% a specific race/culture, it's more likely you'll be met with huge cultural and generational differences and individuals/managers who perpetuate bias and stereotypes.</li>
                        <li>Hard to navigate your way out in a toxic culture as much as company speaks about work life balance, women empowerment, diversity etc..it all really depends on the team and manager.</li>
                        <li>Strict deadlines, forced <b>diversity</b> training</li>
                        <li>There's a lot of lip service to caring about <b>mental</b> health.</li>

                        <li>Rather top down culture.</li>
                        <li>Microsoft is driven from the top-down culture, nothing bubbles up unless your managers do it for you (and they're too scared to disagree with vps) - nepotism & bro culture - they pretend that they are fixing this issue but you will still find a significant amount of teams that only hire the same race and gender (generally men). these teams have been around for over 5 years and they have no interest in changing that dynamic. - "yes" culture and lying in azure. facades and half baked solutions because everything is rushed to simply get the mvp to answer "yes". you will find your managers and developers lying all the time to look better on the surface.</li>
                        <li>The <b>benefits</b> are not great</li>
                        <li>Little exposure to office community/<b>culture</b> while on contract and visible hierarchy between contractors and ftes who maintain identical roles and responsibilities</li>
                        <li>Many layers of management complexity, <b>culture</b> is skin deep and designed more for external perception than internal growth</li>
                        <li><b>Culture</b> is employee friendly, keeps innovating in the wrong ways.</li>

                        <li>Very bureaucratic, odd compensation and measurement system, too internally focused, not a good sales culture</li>
                        <li>Ofcourse, most of the pros and cons will vary from team to team except of things like salary and <b>benefits</b>.</li>
                        <li>Career growth can be a challenge, old rewards culture (not good) still lurks around the corner</li>
                        <li>No pet <b>benefits</b>, no time to enjoy <b>benefits</b>, poor managers</li>
                        <li><b>D&i</b> is generally good, but it can get a little silly sometimes/group think.</li>
                        <li>High paced, high stress and the culture</li>
                        <li>No work-life <b>culture</b> at all</li>
                        <li>Still not <b>diverse</b> enough.</li>

                        <li>Lack of growth opportunities, location, <b>diversity</b> in leadership</li>
                        <li>There is not much of a <b>culture</b> in the office on the east coast.</li>
                        <li>Discrimination during appraisals and yearly reviews</li>
                        <li>If <b>culture</b> and inclusion are important to you, avoid microsoft for now. if this doesn't matter, welcome on board. there is a layer of management that has been here for 15+ and is entrenched in a 'good old boys' <b>culture</b>. if you tow the line and kiss the ring you will be fine. your good ideas are theirs and your bad ones are yours. </li>
                        <li>Hr has weaponized inclusiveness and diversity to mean, "white men please leave".  and there's a heightened culture of victims in waiting.  the statement "everyone has a personal truth" means you can get in trouble for anything.  there are even policies about words and phrases to use that hr wants you to use, but if those preferred words and phrases offend someone you are in trouble.  and there are quiet talks by managers about how the rules are different for white men.  one message is that if a white man sees someone of another category harassing or intimidating someone, they aren't allowed to report.   </li>
                        <li>Some people are set in their ways and not yet participating in the inclusive <b>culture</b>.</li>

                        <li>Some of the cork culture is toxic</li>
                        <li>Political <b>culture</b>, slow promotion timeline</li>
                        <li>Absolutely leaderless and more concerned around talking about diversity than actually thinking about customers.</li>
                        <li>Management culture is quite hierarchical and decisions are made very top-down.</li>
                        <li><b>Diversity</b> and <b>inclusion</b> are great, but are being misused and weaponized unfortunately at all levels.</li>
                        <li>Still not a good place for introverts...although the culture is evolving - mid level leaders haven´t adjusted to the new culture, so they are causing employee sat issues and churn</li>
                        <li>Very hard to navigate culture.</li>
                        <li>They're also all from the pnw and seem to have trouble with people with having individuals from other parts of the world, resulting in an incredibly insular and ignorant <b>culture</b>.</li>
                        <li>While satya has worked to change the culture to be more diverse and inclusive, there are still pockets where speaking up to challenge status quo are still frowned on.</li>
                        <li>Lots of petty politics remain in the <b>culture</b>; very hierarchical</li>
                        <li>Average pay and <b>benefits</b> aren't as competitive as other companies in the area</li>
                        <li>But i think this more to do with the size of the company than a particular <b>culture</b>.</li>
                        <li>Need to work out there <b>culture</b>.</li>
                        <li>Historically engineering-first, feature-driven work <b>culture</b>; extra effort for designers to do some convincing on behalf of the end users...</li>
                        <li>Need to be in right team to reap the <b>benefits</b> of the company</li>
                        <li>Company struggles operationally for continuous improvement - culture of heroes</li>
                        <li>Overly pc - diversity was valued as long as it met their definition of diversity.  true diversity of values was not valued unless your values met their values.</li>
                        <li>Sporadic middle management, diversity misalignment</li>
                        <li>Work-life balance can be challenging but microsoft is flexible and <b>accommodating</b>.</li>
                        <li>Politics, culture isn't strong outside of hq, sales quotas are often very unrealistic</li>
                        <li>The culture and work schedule / demand will take up most if not all of your time. this is a highly competitive place and demands all your attention and energy, which in turn can cause lot of stress.  as long as you can work hard to get the great review, this will be a good place for you.  you should plan to leave as soon as you realize that you are not able to keep up with the demand.</li>
                        <li>The turn over in services is horrendous is due in part to this culture of harassment.</li>
                        <li>The company struggles with <b>culture</b></li>
                        <li>Team dependent culture with too much red tape and frugality</li>
                        <li>Bad work culture, very low stock awards</li>
                        <li>While it's actively being talked about and worked on, there is a bit of a legacy <b>culture</b> with the older teams.</li>
                        <li>All male leadership, not investment in <b>d&i</b>, no action on hr issues. </li>
                        <li>Local top leadership is expecting blind loyalty and obedience, and will burn you out if you don't.</li>
                        <li>Strong power-over hierarchy in the management structure that continues to require employees to be constantly people-pleasing to their leaders in order to succeed, despite all the work to improve the culture.</li>
                        <li>Lack of <b>diversity</b> in technical roles</li>
                        <li>Tendency to jump on the latest bandwagon - product, <b>culture</b>, management mantra</li>
                        <li>A long way to go on <b>inclusive</b> <b>culture</b>, including allowing for different career objectives and encouraging employees to change over time</li>
                        <li><b>Culture</b> in field less "team-centered"</li>
                        <li>Toxic <b>culture</b> overall.</li>
                        <li>Senior lower management have not embraced <b>culture</b> shift</li>
                        <li>Rabid focus on diversity creates reverse discrimination.</li>
                        <li>Groupism, still some folks in management who are in old <b>culture</b></li>
                        <li>Still has large pockets of the 'good ol boy' male domination mentality - lacks modern day <b>diversity</b> in many senior but not corporate leaders</li>
                        <li>Not excellent <b>culture</b>.</li>
                        <li>Pay and benefits are great, but a bit less than leading competitors.</li>
                        <li>Slow to change and not diverse enough.</li>
                        <li>Ie they have never changed their ways to be more <b>inclusive</b> and they never will.</li>
                        <li>Admin <b>culture</b> doesn't align with the <b>culture</b> microsoft preaches. there are no repercussions for managers harrassing their employees, or directly discriminating against them.</li>
                        <li>Strong <b>diversity</b> and <b>inclusion</b> bias forming across the company which can be extremely negative for some people.</li>
                        <li>Take diversity to an extreme</li>
                        <li>The company doesn't value designers (though this <b>culture</b> is slowly changing)</li>
                        <li>Satya did a good job on the image of the company, however when you are inside, many things are the same. diversity and inclusion is a joke. most upper mid-level management (some m2s, most directors, des, junior vps) resist to change, so organizations, ics, m1s get stuck in between.</li>
                        <li>Each team has their own culture and management strategy.</li>
                        <li><b>Culture</b> re-alignment not spreading across the organization.</li>
                        <li>Here is a culture change happening but there are still a lot of the ballmer era people around collecting enormous paychecks. my old gm was reported multiple times for discrimination and yet he is still there.</li>
                        <li>Long hours, need a strong commitment, need to be able to deal with ambiguity as the <b>culture</b> changes and grows.</li>
                        <li>Culture change isn't nearly as far along as you might think: still a lot of pockets of toxicity.</li>
                        <li>Ungodly amount of favoritism, sjw culture, bad management, moving forward is difficult</li>
                        <li>Yes - microsoft is obsessed with diversity but this also means that often the best qualified person didn’t get the job.</li>
                        <li>24/7 on-call duty added after hire with no extra compensation or accommodation.</li>
                        <li>Gender disparity , stop learning, too little diversity</li>
                        <li>More talk than walk about transparency and <b>diversity</b> pervasive water cooler (gossip, <b>blind</b>) atmosphere </li>
                        <li>High salary <b>discrimination</b></li>
                        <li>Some old microsoft habits and <b>culture</b> linger on</li>
                        <li>Pockets of the company still seem to not be reading the <b>culture</b> change memos.</li>
                        <li>I hear the engineering teams' <b>culture</b> is awful.</li>
                        <li>Hard to write that in a way that doesn't sound like a troll, which i'm not, but after years of observation, i don't see a better way to put that - there are no second chances for non-<b>diverse</b> people, so don't screw up. ms is trying to 'solve' <b>diversity</b> & <b>inclusion</b> very aggressively, which is important but unfortunately means that some really great people who don't meet d+i criteria aren't recognized or rewarded at the level they should be (as in, rewards are moved down to free up money for <b>diverse</b> but less effective people), and non-<b>diverse</b> employees are shown the door quickly to make room for … others.</li>
                        <li>Microsoft has had a long culture of hiring male bullies. now ms is putting a lot of marketing $ into "changing the culture" and their so-called commitment to diversity and inclusion.</li>
                        <li>Company culture is a challenge</li>
                        <li><b>Culture</b>, lack of accountability within teams.</li>
                        <li>) no diversity. don't let the rah rah talks fool you. this company doesn't care about promoting women or ethnicities, which is why there's been so many lawsuits. luckily this company has lots and lots of lawyers to fend off all of these lawsuits.</li>
                        <li>Big gap in culture between people in the redmond area vs people in cambridge.</li>
                        <li>Also your experience is hugely, hugely team dependent. local team <b>culture</b> matters way more than anything that happens at top management level. two employees at two different teams can have drastically different lives. maybe the things i list as pros are actually cons in your team, and vice versa. unfortunately there's no real way to tell what it'll be like working on a team until you actually start working there. you can gauge the number of young vs old developers to get a sense of the <b>culture</b> though. the annual review system, which invariably involves peer feedback and encourages backstabbing peers, can be maddening. even after spending several years here, most people will find it's hard to break off of the railroaded promotion system and really shine as a superstar, just due to the seniority-based <b>culture</b> and siloed nature of the work (you don't have the expertise to move into a management role or more technical area that's already being done by someone more senior, but by never doing that role you'll never build expertise).</li>
                        <li>Overindexing on inclusion/diversity that is taking a toll on productivity.</li>
                        <li><b>Inclusive</b> is a word that is used by ceo and all leaders repeat the same.</li>
                        <li>Overall, the organization is filled with gossipy, rest and vest types. i also witnessed a very bright young african american female employee verbally abused and viciously bullied by her manager while senior leaders turned a blind eye. for all of you out there, i would think long and hard before joining the hr function at microsoft.  don’t say that you weren’t warned.</li>
                        <li>There's a bit of kool-aide in that they talk about your "career at microsoft", however it is very rare that skilled individuals move up in the store. promotions and raises seem to be based on diversity hiring tactics and favoritism rather than merit, ability, and professionalism foremost.</li>
                        <li>Diversity is causing challenges for personal growth</li>
                        <li>The company has to hire women as they have to show that they are not discriminating. this is not a new trend but now a unwritten one where women are given the promotion in order to show the world they do not discriminate.</li>
                        <li>It is worth asking about micro-<b>culture</b> details when joining to see how they align with your likes.</li>
                        <li>Also, not-invented-here <b>culture</b> is still pretty strong.</li>
                        <li>Larger groups struggle and continue to support the old guard <b>culture</b>.</li>
                        <li>Lack of <b>diversity</b> in management roles and "boys club" management ranks.</li>
                        <li>Discrimination of women and minorities</li>
                        <li>Design <b>culture</b> needs to pick up</li>
                        <li>Culture stack ranking is toxic</li>
                        <li>Old tech stack, backstabbing <b>culture</b>, less promotion and famous for low ball and underpay</li>
                        <li>This means that you mileage may vary with respect to job satisfaction, depending on whether your group culture suits you. the culture of different groups within microsoft varies markedly.</li>
                        <li>Part of the liberal bubble, too focused on hitting diversity quotas to the detriment of hiring the best candidate for the position</li>
                        <li>Politics, back stabbing, lack of diversity, retaliation, discrimination</li>
                        <li>Culture is stuffy and traditional</li>
                        <li>Be warned, the <b>culture</b> empowers people in power to rape, hr will protect them, what they preach is all smoke and mirrors.</li>
                        <li>Disorganized, mind-numbingly focused on trivial things, stagnant culture</li>
                        <li><b>Culture</b> is pretty old.</li>
                        <li>The old-school top-down micro-managy <b>culture</b> has not gone away yet.</li>
                        <li>It is not a great culture</li>
                        <li>The company's unique <b>culture</b> began to slowly die after bill gates stepped away.</li>
                        <li>Politics or clique is a big issue at the company. the ceo is trying to change the company culture. however, you will find strong resistance to the change from many long-time employees. some people managers are so fake and pretend to care about you. instead, they will manipulate and twist messages to guard their jobs and step on your head for promotion. backstabbing is common to benefit one's own career development.  conversations are not inclusive, and communication is bad. when you are unfairly treated, there is no place for your voice to be heard or for you to be understood. if you try to explain, you will be regarded as too defensive and not willing to embrace the growth mindset. when there's misunderstandings, basically my manager told me to shut up in a polite way. i also have been shut down multiple times by senior employees when i tried to help them understand things on a project.</li>
                        <li>Political <b>culture</b>, work life balance can be hard</li>
                        <li>Team <b>culture</b> might not be aligned with company-wide <b>culture</b></li>
                        <li>The work <b>culture</b> at msft is brilliant.</li>
                        <li><b>Culture</b> experience is very dependent on which team you join</li>
                        <li>Still the <b>culture</b> has to change in few orgs</li>
                        <li><b>Culture</b> needs much more work specially at new sites!</li>
                        <li>Middle management are disconnected from the company <b>culture</b> and reality.</li>
                        <li>But microsoft benefits are one of the best out there</li>
                        <li>Red tape of corporate <b>culture</b>, slow working environment, too many rules to get stuff done</li>
                        <li>Work/life balance, <b>benefits</b> less than before</li>

                        <li>Idc doesn't have the great culture that's present in redmond under nadella. office teams in general have much more politics compared to azure and bing. but office exchange team is in next level. they selected managers and director with zero managerial experience who are always complaining and shouting in meetings.</li>
                        <li>Corporate-like career, everyone advances at the same pace, with little considerations of <b>abilities</b></li>
                        <li>As a new hire at a low level, i was discriminated against assigning worthy work. i'm guessing it is easy for them to justify the <b>discrimination</b> citing my level. no promotions for the same reason. <b>discrimination</b> based on the language spoken</li>
                        <li>The culture in the different microsoft subsidiaries varies tremendously between the different geographies - some embrace the overall corporate culture and some reflect a more local culture. i switched between the uk and apac and although it was an amazing experience in hindsight, the company did not prepare me for this in any way.</li>
                        <li>Lot of politics that includes lying and intetional misrepresentation of the truth. very toxic <b>culture</b> that sucks the life out of you immediately.</li>
                        <li>The australian sub has gone through a terrible change over 2019 and needs a good shake up, the <b>culture</b> is like ibm in the 90s or like a chapter written by jack welch. back stabbing, lack of transparency, a lot of insecure people who throw others under a bus to save themselves and i am talking about the leadership teams. lastly i want to highlight i saw a lot of poor treatment of people by management while hr turned a <b>blind</b> eye. hiring of people in roles that were already filled by other people. being told one day you are performing well, then the next day being pulled into hr meetings to say you were not meeting expectations. roles are being downgraded by 2 levels forcing people to leave so management can hire their friends. or worst yet people made redundant one week and two weeks later asked to come back. no one knows where they stand all while the numbers are crashing.</li>
                        <li>Poor regional leadership and <b>culture</b>... corruption and brown-nosing are more important that competence</li>

                        <li>Culture: lack of ownership</li>
                        <li>Not unexpected from a pm, but <b>culture</b> of monthly leadership reviews leads to too much randomisation and churn without much movement on the ground.</li>
                        <li>D&i gone mad: before i start, i 100% believe in workplace equality - equal opportunities for men and women of any race. that said, even though 20% of computer science grads are female, microsoft's push for 50% of senior staff being female and will "positively discriminate" for roles. in talking to managers you are often given the heads-up not to apply for a role as this needs to be a female hire. this has gone so far that there are rumours that senior male execs being offered large packages to 'voluntarily' exit. also when restructuring rounds go around, it is very rare for females to be considered, meaning male job security is lower than females. </li>
                        <li>Hard to transition over to corporate,not all <b>benefits</b> are accessible to part timers (eg.</li>

                        <li> sometimes team <b>culture</b> & personal/career growth depends on your manager, just like elsewhere.</li>
                        <li>Everything. lower management is terrible, upper management even worse. they don't give a damn about people. only money and work is important. forget about good bonuses if you don't agree to work like 60 hours a week - excelling at your job in normal work hours is not enough for good bonus or a promotion. people who agree to do that are praised by managers and put on the pedestal, ruining the work <b>culture</b>.</li>
                        <li>Contingency staff are not well funded comparing to ftes nor have good <b>benefits</b> even though they might be better than ftes, but in general they have salaries better than the other companies.</li>

                        <li>On top of it, they are encouraging groupisim which is  changing the work <b>culture</b>.</li>
                        <li>The leadership talks about <b>diversity</b> but its all straight white men which, worse of it all, have been at microsoft for ever, so they have no clue how to really apply <b>culture</b> change. they dont even know what an innovative <b>culture</b> looks like and that includes the poster boy, satya, who is the most hierarchical, corporate of them all, despite his "family" story which has been totally overrated.</li>
                        <li>If you’re ambitious and want to make a difference or grow in your career, don’t come here. you’ll be frustrated and pushing constantly uphill. whilst the growth mindset is preached, it’s not the reality. the culture doesn’t support it, the reporting lines don’t support it and least of all, management doesn’t support it.</li>

                        <li>The local company <b>culture</b> is insane - at some point, you will be regularly working illegal amounts of overtime, working while sick, working over weekends or working at night and asking yourself why did you even come here.</li>
                        <li>Polluted <b>culture</b>. very unfriendly. a shocker for anyone stepping in from outside world. women (exploring new opportunities), please stay away from this place. your struggles are unique. its your hard earned career. do not spoil it.  the place is not <b>diversity</b> ready yet (for the women's wing) and will take a few years too for it. you will not receive satisfactory support and will be on your own here.</li>

                        <li>Lots of people are now london or uk based and the culture in the office has been lost as more and more people work remotely.</li>
