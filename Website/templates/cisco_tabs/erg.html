                          last round of disability. Eight months later, she landed at Cisco and was blown away with the
                          employee resources, including the Cancer Support Network. “When I joined, I thought, wow! What
                          an amazing community of people who have battled themselves, or are caregivers, or loved ones
                          of people who have gone through it,” Davis said. <br> <br>

                          and education. At the same time, it introduces new challenges. How can organizations empower
                          all people, regardless of hearing, vision, and mobility level, to contribute equally? And how
                          can those same organizations provide equal service to their customers with disabilities? The
                          extent to which an organization provides equal access shapes its productivity, responsiveness,
                          and ability to attract and retain the most qualified employees, regardless of disability. It
                          also increases the organization's service levels to a distinct segment of its customer base,
                          positively affecting customer satisfaction and revenue. <br> <br>
