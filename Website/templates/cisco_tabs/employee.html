                  <li>PROS:
                  -- Positive Work environment / Corporate Culture.
                  
                  -- Constant Exposure to New Technology.
                  
                  -- Endless opportunities to develop existing skills, learn new skills on the job, and change roles.
                  
                  -- Leadership is dedicated to making the company feel like one large team or family where everyone is there to help everyone else (not always practiced of course).
                  
                  -- An extremely well organized and streamlined company.
                  
                  -- Company culture heavily promotes internal-innovation and is very open to hearing about (and trying out) ideas of employees if they are innovative, reasonable, doable, and the employee is willing to make them a reality.
                  
                  -- Technical ability and breadth of technical knowledge are prized commodities company-wide, even among non-technical roles, and often go hand-in-hand with opportunities for personal development and advancement.
                  
                  -- Positive attitudes are well rewarded and those with a consistently negative outlook often find themselves a victim of the Annual limited restructuring events.
                  
                  -- The annual layoffs do not usually impact technical workers (and their supporting coworkers) that are focused on growing / profitable technologies and products.</li>

                  Being an engineer I love the technology, I am excited working with the industry leading products and how our leaders are redefining the industry. There are regular inclusion and diversity events, we have early in career events regularly and on the whole. Be it a day off on your birthday, or the flexibility when it comes to working, Cisco's culture is something I truly love about working here.
                  
                  Whilst every company has its ups and downs, I have no intention of moving away from Cisco any time soon. Be it where we work, the people, the products & services we create and sell or the culture of the organisation, I have heard of very few organisations that can match the whole package that Cisco offers.
                  
                  As an employee of Cisco I have been able to work from home, I can work flexible hours, I get to work on the move, I've been fortunate enough to travel (a lot). Being a systems engineer in sales my work is flexible, although I regularly see other engineers being given their own space to relax and even get pizza  every Friday for lunch!
                  
                  Within Cisco I met more cultures, nationalities, religions and diversities than I  ever had before. 
                  
                  I touched on the culture earlier.</li>

                <h4>Negative Comments</h4>
                  <li>Large company culture, so the silos take a lot of effort to break down...but we are getting there,</li>
                  <li>Salaries are on the lower end but other benefits do help compensate.</li>
                  <li>Slow work culture if you are someone who loves to work at faster paces</li>

                  <li>Leadership diversity and Frequent reorganizations</li>
                  <li>Big pond, may be hard to grow a career for most
                  Culture may be changing in the neat future</li>
                  <li>Change is part of Cisco's culture.</li>
                  <li>
                   Teams do not always operate in the MOST effective manner and using duplicate tools/processes
                   Middle management + hiring managers still have a long way to go in terms of cross culture competence and D&I value (But there are A LOT of progressive people and leaders here who get it)  With start up culture it means that we are constantly changing (lots of org shifts, lay offs, ect.)</li>
                  <li>Culture shift happening with a heavy influence from Salesforce</li>
                  <li>Yearly LR's; Talks Diversity and Inclusion but not practiced</li>
                  <li>Unofficially managers get really petty when this happens and usually drops your bonus to minimum.
                  Technology and tools is generally behind the curve, huge legacy issues prevent investment in reworking.
                  Advancement/pay raises usually very limited, however not for lack of desire by direct managers.
                  Company culture is pretty bland, team cultures vary.
                  No dedicated sick time</li>

                  <li>Lots of work needed in the D&I space.</li>
                  <li>Also, it's not a young work culture, but depending on your preferences may not be a con.</li>

                  <li>Culture is not generally accepting of LGBTQ+ people
                  Little effort or importance put into hiring lgbtq+ talent or ensuring their teams will be welcoming or accepting
                  Ineffective HR department offering lgbtq+ employees the runaround instead of adequate support; HR is also undereducated on lgbtq+ identity and issues, with no feedback loop in place for complaints against HR
                  Little effort by teams within the company to live out the corporate values of inclusion and collaboration
                  Dishonest reporting on lgbtq+ inclusion metrics by some leadership</li>
                  <li>It’s easy to burn out, overwork and/or negatively impact your health (that’s where the medical benefits come in handy).

                  Cisco is rapidly replacing senior professionals with millennials. Shareholders love saving money  diversity is improving  but the lack of experience shows.</li>

                  <li>The culture faded with the acquisition.</li>
                  <li>Poor culture  we say we do a lot for diversity but does not play out in practice.</li>
                  <li>Bad culture and not really making anything to change</li>
                  <li>Cisco has become “woke”, increasing amounts of time and effort are being consumed with diversity efforts. The fundamental motivator is fear among many, midcareer and beyond.</li>
                  <li>didn't find any, culture and life balance it good</li>
                  <li>Very limited diversity and career growth</li>
                  <li>While Cisco is a large company, which provides opportunities to change roles/departments, being so large also is a negative (lots of processes, hard to find opportunities in the roles you are in)
                  The work culture depends on the team you are on, leadership are trying to create better alignment, but when people managers don't attend those meetings, it's hard to enforce the culture they promote
                  Frequent internal reorgs</li>
                  <li>During annual 'Limited Restructures', it's not about being a rock star or not, it's your position that is eliminated including whole teams
                   Tight weekly commits can cause stress within teams depending on management
                   Marketing has continued to overpromise or oversell, Cisco didn't use to sell on roadmaps
                   dilution of culture.</li>
                  <li>Politics with a capital P plus some; Innovation is a prized quality at Cisco however individuals trying to work through and contribute to transformation are passively punished for not doing things the Cisco way; Lack of alignment between enterprise strategy and team executions  most managers keep doing what they want to do regardless of what the stated organization and corporate strategy; Frequent and disruptive leadership shakeups in IT; nonengineering roles  despite lip service are not valued; There is very little respect for worklife balance unless you put your own boundaries up  which is problematic especially as we strive to do better with mental health for ourselves and our coworkers.</li>
                  <li>Benefits are very good and somewhat compensate for low pay.</li>
                  <li>culture is lacking and poor work/life balance</li>
                  <li>Poor culture, layoff every year, low employee morale</li>
                  <li>Can be stressful and feel as though your underwater sometimes.
                  Pay isn't the best for this industry, but most of the benefits make up for it.</li>
                  <li>Arrogance very high
                  Legacy solutions not cloud friendly
                  Middle Management have rose colored glasses
                  Too many gatekeeper inside the machine
                  Most managers are spreadsheet jockeys, not leaders
                  ELT is nose blind on how the trenches smell
                  CEO needs to fix machine, not be so concerned how he looks public facing
                  Layoffs schedule is rampant
                  Not focused on customer but themselves
                  Not too channel friendly</li>
                  <li>salary, culture, ceo, team lead</li>
                  <li>Several first, second and third line managers do not embrace the culture and framework established by the SLT.</li>
                  <li>Culture, good ole boys network</li>
                  <li>The top leadership of the company talks about diversity, equality, and no bullying, but it doesn't make it down the chain.</li>
                  <li>There are obviously things within the culture that are a little strange just because they are pretty progressive but nothing too crazy</li>
                  <li>The culture is built around fear and obedience.</li>
                  <li>The culture of Cisco is not very great.</li>
                  <li>Most managers knowingly do this, that benefits some lazy full time employees with poor performance and too many personal priorities during the work hours, who doesn't have visa limitations.</li>
                  <li>dependent on manager for culture</li>
                  <li>Completely selfstarted, no support from management to get on your feet
                  Onboarding was the worst I'd ever experienced
                  No worklife balance, even though it is a touted benefit
                  Long nights, missing weekends
                  Forced office shutdowns that detract from PTO, so the PTO you get is actually get to use for yourself are a few days shorter than advertised.
                  Meetings and collaboration is so dysfunctional, even exec team warns employees that 'Cisco will consume you if you let it', yet you are penalized if you do not devote 24/7 of your personal life to the company.
                  No support from management when needed due to an opticsdriven culture</li>
                  <li>Culture is cut throat. A lot of bigotry is real that hides behind Inclusion and Diversity talk.</li>
                  <li>There are teams that have a fantastic, warm culture, while other teams play favorites, politics and there is no accountability.</li>
                  <li>God father culture.</li>
                  <li>Sometimes one gets lost in companies work culture</li>
                  <li>culturewise isn't good. not diversity</li>
                  <li>Micromanaging from the top, poor culture, most decent talent has fled or been fired.</li>
                  <li>Some teams are not very diverse, and frequent lay offs</li>
                  <li>Serious lack of diversity, eroding benefits, constant threat of layoff</li>
                  <li>There is not much diversity in certain teams  seems some teams are made of the same ethnic group.</li>
                  <li>Subtle discrimination which is very hard to see but largely prevalent.</li>
                  <li>Situations like this really show that at the end of the day, a giant corporation that genuinely cares about its workers wellbeing, is still a giant corporation.

                   The Annual layoffs

                   Even when an employee is paid something close to fair market value for a specific role, the pay is typically lower than what the vast majority of other organizations will pay, and the benefits (once amazing beyond compare!)</li>
                  <li>annual layoffs and new micromanagement culture makes it difficult to get actual work done.</li>
                  <li>Less Benefits compared to other companies</li>
                  <li>not a startup culture due to the size</li>
                  <li>work culture
                  difficulties to climb up the ladder</li>
                  <li>Hard left political culture at senior leadership level. They layoff thousands, yet spend $100M on diversity initiatives.</li>
                  <li>Need more diversity in management</li>
                  <li>bad management, poor work culture</li>
                  <li>They are fostering a culture that does nothing but alienate those that helped to build the company.</li>

                  Bad working culture.</li>
                  <li>Culture is slow to adapt to changing competition</li>
                  <li>Annual limited restructuring impacts the culture</li>
                  <li>just about everything else... culture has tanked</li>
                  <li>Very meetingheavy culture, so this is definitely not for you if you aren’t a people person.</li>
                  <li>sometime less startup culture</li>
                  <li>Culture is really bad.</li>
                  <li>Salary may be average, but benefits do add up and makes it an attractive package</li>

                  <li>Lack of diversity in management.</li>
                  <li>One must not criticise corporate culture lest you will be flagged</li>
                  <li>Work/life balance can be a challenge, the push to do more with less is always there and it's difficult hearing that there is never money for new hires.</li>
                  <li>Internal messaging is overly optimistic and comes across disingenuous
                  Talent level is on decline
                  Culture has changed</li>
                  <li>The perks and benefits are getting worst every year.</li>
                  <li>Had a fairly political culture.</li>
                  <li>Some things hadn't changed in years or decades, but there were also (from my perspective) unnecessary and disruptive changes while I was there; big changes in both health and retirement benefits providers within one year.</li>
                  <li>Long hours, especially for multinational focused positions, poor retirement benefits.</li>
                  <li>Some policies clearly indicate management doesn't trust employees to do their jobs without supervision.
                  Despite preaching the benefits of fulltime remote work for employers since the early 90s, Cisco limits fulltime remote work opportunities.</li>
                  <li>layoffs yearly, cross training to fill gaps in need lacking, direction and CA culture floundering due to outsourcing everything, stagnant despite moving to more software based, no momentum</li>
                  <li>process heavy, toxic culture nepotism is the worst</li>
                  <li>Culture in some parts of the organization</li>
                  <li>depending in your BU culture, execution can be slow</li>
                  <li>However other benefits may make up for this depending on what is important to you.</li>
                  <li>Customers can be a pain and the Sales culture at Cisco can breed some real Sh*!</li>
                  <li>you need to understand the culture of this particular group.</li>
                  <li>the number of jobs with benefits of remote work are decreasing</li>
                  <li>Culture is held above all else  but nobody shows you how to map into it.</li>
                  <li>But good culture definitely depends on your leadership and the organization you're in  lay offs do happen frequently at Cisco</li>
                  <li>But the culture is changing positively

                  <li>It is not a very healthy work culture as always try to play the blame game</li>
                  <li>Benefits are ok</li>

                  <li>hard to advance, very political, and phoney culture</li>
                  <li>Sr Directors down to firstline managers are hit or miss, they can really destroy the culture the csuite has set and can be incredibly toxic.</li>

                  <li>Not easily accessible by public transpiration.
                  Have to deal hearing profanity from other coworkers.</li>
                  <li>Worked for Cisco for over 10 years the best I can say Benefits are good.
                  In Cisco Austin it is a crap shoot depending on the Business unit your team might be part off.</li>
                  <li>Less workplace benefits than some top tech companies Lack of general diversity, though management is working on it.</li>
                  <li>Very political culture in engineering
                  Heavy process and lots of decision makers in the oragnizatoin
                  No raises for years, only RSUs</li>

                  <li>Culture can vary based on what part of the organization you are in</li>
                  <li>Difficult since the culture is so remote, especially for early in career/ those who do not want to work from home or want an inperson culture to go to each day.</li>

                  High Pressure Sales Culture</li>
                  <li>We are making big strides in promoting women to leadership roles across all ranks and there is more to be done with great initiatives like Multiplier Effect and Multiply Tech Diversity initiatives.</li>
                  <li>It's a big complicated company with a diverse portfolio of products.</li>
                  <li>I was also discriminated against because I was a woman with a voice and an opinion. Favoritism and clique culture was rife.</li>
                  <li>Corporate change is difficult, big company culture</li>
                  <li>Some teams needs more diversity.</li>
                  <li>Some groups seriously have NO diversity at all, resulting in very toxic environments.</li>
                  <li>Culture is one of teams throwing each other under the bus, in order for them to look better by comparison.</li>
                  <li>Ever since Chambers left the positive family employee culture is gone.</li>
                  <li>Forecasting culture doesn't make sense for government accounts</li>
                  <li>few bad managers and their bad culture</li>
                  <li>Politics
                  Unwarranted layoffs
                  No Millenials Benefits
                  Old Values</li>
                  <li>oh man after 4 years you definitely start seeing the cracks:
                   Open discrimination against men is pretty tolerant here, I.E. I was told it was good that I was discriminated against because I'm not a minority.</li>
                  <li>No diversity in engineering workforce.</li>
                  <li>Not much work life balance it’s very hard to truly be “off” when taking PTO
                  Not much diversity in sales teams a lot of the reqs say “purple hair?</li>
                  <li>Too many layoffs which creates an unstable culture and too much churn.</li>
                  <li>The culture is struggling to evolve, but the old culture has a stronghold  too engineering driven, too reactive, not proactive, in approach to software design.</li>
                  <li>Wish there was a better gym membership in the benefits</li>
                  <li>As in all Tech Companies, are growing pains, in culture, lack of minorities.</li>
                  <li>Many managers will devise ways to get rid of those who don't agree with their opinions by withholding bonuses, prevent any movement to other teams, uncomfortable 1 conversations, etc.

                  Also the division between FTEs and contractors is very apparent and the pay disparity is embarrassing as are the benefits (read none). Although working from home was a nice benefit, none of the great benefits you'd like to find at a Silicon Valley company like free food and other services.</li>
                  <li>It's a highly bureaucratic culture that rushes from crisis to crisis without adequate strategic accountability.</li>
                  <li>Loyalty to employees not there all smoke and mirrors.
                  They layoff yearly and quarterly regardless of performance.
                  Unless your indian  there is no inclusion or diversity
                  Low compensation vs the industry and competitors</li>
                  <li>The individual performance only matters to a minimal extent as we keep hearing from our managers and directors over and over again that the BU did not get enough budget for promotions or hikes.</li>
                  <li>Hard to get promoted, jobs/tasks change constantly, low diversity</li>
                  <li>large company culture due to infusion of very large company people</li>
                  <li>short term thinking and wall street focus is killing the culture that was once great</li>
                  <li>The culture is no longer what it was once...</li>
                  <li>Crabs in a bucket culture due to the fact there are limited FTE positions everyone is mostly contractor.</li>
                  <li>lack of transparency of performance evaluations,  management sees middle management as expendable, no sense of urgency, layoff culture, job rotations are not as often as peers,  process, tools and training sub par for large company, lots of politics.</li>
                  <li>Little balance, strategies shirt on a dime, they say diverse but ipmore and more is swept under a run</li>
                  <li>Many times you are working extra hours on products or solutions that will never produce revenue.
                  We were looking over our shoulder every 4 years.
                  Company is extremely biased towards hiring younger engineers.
                  Diversity and inclusion only applies to employees and managers in the US.</li>
                  <li>So the senior engineers there are basically just going through the motions because the pay is pretty good, the benefits are basically second to none, and they don't want to lose that.</li>
                  <li>The great culture at Cisco has really taken a hit in the last 6 months.</li>
                  <li>Lack of diversity.</li>
                  <li>Not equal opportunity employment.</li>
                  <li>Very cheap for employee benefits. Uneven diversity  too many clique racial groups.</li>
                  <li>One team can have a great, cohesive culture while another can be isolating.</li>
                  <li>They talk a lot about collaboration culture but it is passive aggressive and lot of command and control. This culture is widely prevalent.</li>

                  <li>They talk a lot about collaboration culture but it is passive aggressive and lot of command and control. This culture is widely prevalent.</li>
                  <li>Lack of benefits like free food & snacks.</li>
                  <li>Advancement is slow and dependent on arbitrary metrics that workers have no visibility into
                  * I've been in my position 2 years without a single formal review of my abilities.
                  * The politics are absurd at times  you have to worry about hurting peoples' feelings, as Cisco is very feelgood.</li>
                  <li>The team you're on largely determines whether the work you do is exciting vs. mundane, whether you can work from home or if you have to be in the office every day for scrum.

                  In the end you are still working for an IT company that heavily values technical skills and abilities (design, marketing, HR, is always going to be secondary to software engineering, database, front end dev, etc.) Essentially you must have coding skills/abilities/understanding to succeed or work here.

                  Biggest con: the location.</li>
                  <li>Any global company comes with its bureaucratic challenges, but Cisco maintains a culture of curiosity and innovation that encourages growth throughout your career through challenging the status quo.</li>
                  <li>Bad benefits and bonus system.</li>
                  <li>Mostly hard working culture  less balance on fun.</li>
                  <li>The choice of benefits could be better</li>
                  <li>In some BUs employee growth is stunted because they are buried under unnecessary multilevel management chains
                  Engineering lacks diversity</li>
                  <li>Culture becoming more ruthless  not the Cisco we knew and loved; Yearly reductions in staff; New CLevel; Lots of internal marketing to employees</li>
                  <li>One feels left out as the culture is pretty clannish if you get hired from the outside.</li>
                  <li>Negative culture and people trying to grab your role.</li>
                  <li>Nothing Bad, great conditions, great benefits</li>
                  <li>no benefits for full tim e</li>
                  <li>
                  Foreigners do not stay long, due to cultaral maching with Polish work culture.</li>

                  Management not transparent</li>
                  <li>worklife balance and lots of other benefits</li>
                  <li>The amazing culture makes up for it.
                  PS: There is increased migration to newer and more powerful tech stack all across the company.</li>
                  <li>Great culture and fantastic teams</li>
                  <li>You get stuck because you like the culture and your salary keeps getting less with your outside friends.</li>
                  <li>There is a subculture in UK and its not very inclusive if your face doesn't fit.
                  Underhand tactics when it comes to promotions and hiring.</li>
                  <li>Work culture, atmosphere, US oriented</li>
                  <li>Best employee benefits and no drawback.</li>
                  <li>There can be improvements in inclusion</li>
                  <li>Slow pace, too much churn at senior/top levels
                   Old tools/tech in many projects
                   Rotten culture in some BUs due to annual pink slips</li>
                  <li>Not diverse in workplace (mostly middle aged men)</li>
                  <li>Cisco is not ONE big company, it is a combination of hundreds of small companies.
                  Some team culture is just like what they used to be as a small company. Depends on which team you are working in, the culture is very different.</li>
                  <li>Diversity, they try hard but unconscious still less opportunities for women.</li>
                  <li>Compensations and benefits and Career opportunities</li>
                  <li>Not showing respect or inclusive attitude becomes the norm in some department.</li>
                  <li>
                  Most people are focused on personal growth and what benefits their progression rather than actually doing whats right .</li>
                  <li>Depending heavily on leaders how they cultivate the culture.</li>
                  <li>Some US stakeholders could be very difficult, esp those who don’t follow company culture recommended by senior leadership(purely my experience)</li>
                  <li>Work pressure is tough and with the amount of flexibility they give you choice paralysis might be an issue</li>
                  <li>Manager should be old Cisco person for you to enjoy the real Cisco culture</li>
                  <li>Insular culture due to fear of being fired on yearly shakedown of employee count</li>
                  <li>Diversity of opinions are not welcomed. Lot of hot air about diversity and the SJW agenda, and rahrah cultlike atmosphere growing out of control. Layoff culture; continous rounds of large layoffs each time the business dips, which is about every two years, as a standard operating procedure.</li>
                  <li>I always wanted to work for Cisco, but over the past several years I've seen a decline in culture and quality.</li>
                  <li>None, management is great and work culture is excellent.</li>
                  <li>Overall benefits (except insurance) is not the best of what other competitors or typical top IT companies are offering, surprisingly behind.</li>
                  <li>local is an issue with culture and is challenging diversity</li>
                  <li>Very bad benefits and work life balance</li>
                  <li>Be careful to manage your calendar wisely, 24/7 always on culture will take all of your after work hours if you let it!</li>
                  <li>Technical not get benefits likewise sales</li>
                  <li>Hire fire culture in recent years</li>
                  <li>Top down culture, a lot of restructuring affecting people.</li>
                  <li>Top down culture, a lot of restructuring affecting people.</li>
                  <li>Benefits vary too much from location to location, employee portal is a labyrinthian nightmare</li>
                  <li>Culture, Flexibility in changing projects</li>
                  <li>However, the benefits package like stocks, bonuses, etc usually makes Cisco a better option.</li>
                  <li>Hire and fire culture, poor midmanagement level, too much discrepancies in salary and grade levels.</li>
                  <li>Poor midmanagement; Strategy & governance is lacking in some areas; Performance + development process is broken; Culture of internal competition is growing</li>
                  <li>Kind of like a government company culture where loyalty/seniority matters more.</li>
                  <li>Less Compensation benefits No RSU shares for freshers Working Hours</li>
                  <li>Some BU leadership, diversity, the new cisco could me confused</li>

                   partner culture</li>
                  <li>Culture, Management, Politics, Local to Global communication</li>
                  <li>Lack of gender diversity in sales</li>
                  <li>They are actively covering up and misrepresenting the scale of the harm their sales teams are being subjected to by wilfully discriminating both financially and through their actions, against anyone who suffers mental ill health due to the stresses of the role. Cisco discriminate against people who have mental health issues. Cisco's culture causes mental illness far too regularly. Also, not enough support to avoid burnout  Always connected culture leads to burnout  likely to be harassed by sales leadership quite often including evenings and weekends.</li>
                  <li>Benefits are not that great.</li>

                  <li>Promotions are limited and its more of a beauty contest than based on your abilities</li>
                  <li>It's like everyone's working for the company and they could be a fulltime employee, but they're not, and that originates frustration and unnecessary competition, undermining the otherwise close to perfect culture the company has. The strong vendor/contractor culture is definitely a con.</li>
                  <li>Very toxic culture. It’s an office culture of bullying, where if you don’t subscribe to toxic masculinity beliefs, you are belittled as a coleague and as a man.</li>

                  <li>Expect that the kind of culture you get from your cohort/ CSAP hub will change, depending on the country/hub you move to after the end of the program. Some of the fantastic culture you are you used to looses panache; this is common when you move from a larger hub to a much smaller one.</li>
                  <li>Thankfully Cisco is a constantly changing and adapting company and you find that management has to adapt as well.

                  Being a Systems Engineer can feel like a thankless role at times within the company, but the opportunity to work with cutting  edge technology and the culture in the company far far far outweigh this.

                  Generally it is accepted that Cisco pays slightly less than others in the industry, however given the job security, additional benefits like health care, pension etc etc, I have always been happy with my pay.</li>

                  <li>got more benefits from the company</li>
                  <li>Pockets of toxic culture
                  Benefits are limited</li>
                  <li>Culture of nepotism, classicism etc.</li>
                  <li>Gender discrimination in the name if diversity, local sales management is flag bearer of nepotism.</li>
                  <li>It is no longer the Cisco it was 5 to 10 years back, culture wise atleast.</li>
                  <li>we had a person on a team who was spending 50% of the time or more on some inclusion trainings and presentations and not doing the job mostly, and that is considered a norm, yet workload was counted toward them too (per person average).</li>
                  <li>nothing as such,  Cisco culture is best in word</li>
                  <li>Most managers are Poles and while there's this appearance of inclusion and diversity within the company, at the end of the day you'll see locals (or Ukranians, the second biggest community) progressing in their career,  getting promotions, recognitions, and so on... while it happens way too rarely for internationals (in proportion with the number of people, of course).

                   Being a low cost center in a saturated market like Krakow, the quality of talent Cisco manages to get there is not so high.

                   No meritocracy AT ALL.

                   No metrics/KPI / good place for early retirement: you will find lots of people in who just put in a few hours of work per day, get to work at 10:00, leave at 15:000, go for groceries in the meantime... and nobody cares, because there is no way whatsoever to measure anybody's performance (beside in a very few roles). Middle management in Cisco Krakow is really mediocre, and definitely not diverse.</li>
                  <li>All benefits makes you lazy in a way</li>
                  <li>All benefits makes you lazy in a way</li>
                  <li>Benefits on the downturn affecting the employees.</li>
                  <li>The UK sales management are bringing a political culture to Cisco that it didn't have before.</li>
                  <li>Bad management, the company does not practice what they preach with their inclusion, diversity and bullying policy</li>
                  <li>Layoff culture, too many reorgs, Business Units creating overlapping/competing solutions under the same domain, Work life balance, promotions are based on social ladder instead of contribution ladder</li>
                  <li>Why expand in India if the team doesn't want it?
                  The team isn't diverse either.</li>
                  <li>Pay is rather low compare to the market
                  Average benefits, few of them being taken away :(
                  There is few great people but the culture coming from the upper management is disgusting, saying you either with us or you should live ... not nery motivating on  convincing.</li>
                  <li>Slow moving Constant changes Culture</li>
                  <li>Less stability, moderate work culture.</li>
