                        <li>Pros:
                        -- positive work environment / corporate <b>culture</b>.
                        
                        -- constant exposure to new technology.
                        
                        -- endless opportunities to develop existing skills, learn new skills on the job, and change roles.
                        
                        -- leadership is dedicated to making the company feel like one large team or family where everyone is there to help everyone else (not always practiced of course).
                        
                        -- an extremely well organized and streamlined company.
                        
                        -- company <b>culture</b> heavily promotes internal-innovation and is very open to <b>hearing</b> about (and trying out) ideas of employees if they are innovative, reasonable, doable, and the employee is willing to make them a reality.
                        
                        -- technical ability and breadth of technical knowledge are prized commodities company-wide, even among non-technical roles, and often go hand-in-hand with opportunities for personal development and advancement.
                        
                        -- positive attitudes are well rewarded and those with a consistently negative outlook often find themselves a victim of the annual limited restructuring events.
                        
                        -- the annual layoffs do not usually impact technical workers (and their supporting coworkers) that are focused on growing / profitable technologies and products.</l1>
                        <li>Great <b>benefits</b>, smart people, good <b>culture</b></l1>

                        <li>Great <b>benefits</b>, great vacation, great lateral opportunities</l1>
                        <li><b>Benefits</b>, people, 401k, espp, and technology</li>
                        <li><b>Diversity</b> is valued with a lot of minorities and women in leadership roles.</li>
                        <li>They are super transparent and are not shy about talking about various topics ranging from social justice to <b>mental</b> health.</l1>

                      <li>Large company <b>culture</b>, so the silos take a lot of effort to break down...but we are getting there,</li>
                      <li>Salaries are on the lower end but other <b>benefits</b> do help compensate.</li>

                      <li>Big pond, may be hard to grow a career for most
                      culture may be changing in the neat future</li>
                      <li>Change is part of cisco's <b>culture</b>.</li>
                      <li>With start up <b>culture</b> it means that we are constantly changing (lots of org shifts, lay offs, ect.) 
                      - teams do not always operate in the most effective manner and using duplicate tools/processes
                      - middle management + hiring managers still have a long way to go in terms of cross- <b>culture</b> competence and d&i value (but there are a lot of progressive people and leaders here who get it)</li>
                      <li><b>Culture</b> shift happening with a heavy influence from salesforce</li>
                      <li>Yearly lr's; talks diversity and inclusion but not practiced</li>
                      <li>Unofficially managers get really petty when this happens and usually drops your bonus to minimum.
                      technology and tools is generally behind the curve, huge legacy issues prevent investment in reworking.
                      advancement/pay raises usually very limited, however not for lack of desire by direct managers.
                      company culture is pretty bland, team cultures vary.
                      no dedicated sick time</li>
                      <li>Slow moving for silicon valley culture, high risks of getting affected by layoffs and group changes due to decisions made at very high levels that don't always make sense.</li>
                      <li>Lots of work needed in the d&i space.</li>
                      <li>Also, it's not a young work <b>culture</b>, but depending on your preferences may not be a con.</li>
                      <li>Slow moving <b>culture</b>/lots of hoops to jump through to make change</li>
                      <li>Bad pay but great <b>benefits</b></li>
                      <li>Lack of <b>diversity</b>, very political and middle management plays favourism.</li>
                      <li><b>Culture</b> is not generally accepting of lgbtq+ people
                      little effort or importance put into hiring lgbtq+ talent or ensuring their teams will be welcoming or accepting
                      ineffective hr department offering lgbtq+ employees the run-around instead of adequate support; hr is also undereducated on lgbtq+ identity and issues, with no feedback loop in place for complaints against hr
                      little effort by teams within the company to live out the corporate values of <b>inclusion</b> and collaboration
                      dishonest reporting on lgbtq+ <b>inclusion</b> metrics by some leadership</li>
                      <li>Shareholders love saving money - diversity is improving - but the lack of experience shows. it’s easy to burn out, overwork and/or negatively impact your health (that’s where the medical <b>benefits</b> come in handy).
                      
                      cisco is rapidly replacing senior professionals with millennials.</li>
                      <li>The <b>culture</b> faded with the acquisition.</li>
                      <li>Poor <b>culture</b> - we say we do a lot for <b>diversity</b> but does not play out in practice.</li>
                      <li>Bad <b>culture</b> and not really making anything to change</li>
                      <li>The fundamental motivator is fear among many, mid-career and beyond. cisco has become “woke”, increasing amounts of time and effort are being consumed with <b>diversity</b> efforts.</li>
                      <li>Didn't find any, <b>culture</b> and life balance it good</li>
                      <li>Very limited <b>diversity</b> and career growth</li>
                      <li>While cisco is a large company, which provides opportunities to change roles/departments, being so large also is a negative (lots of processes, hard to find opportunities in the roles you are in)
                      the work <b>culture</b> depends on the team you are on, leadership are trying to create better alignment, but when people managers don't attend those meetings, it's hard to enforce the <b>culture</b> they promote
                      frequent internal reorgs</li>
                      <li>During annual 'limited restructures', it's not about being a rock star or not, it's your position that is eliminated including whole teams
                      - tight weekly commits can cause stress within teams depending on management
                      - marketing has continued to overpromise or oversell, cisco didn't use to sell on roadmaps
                      - dilution of culture.</li>
                      <li>Politics with a capital p plus some; innovation is a prized quality at cisco however individuals trying to work through and contribute to transformation are passively punished for not doing things the cisco way; lack of alignment between enterprise strategy and team executions - most managers keep doing what they want to do regardless of what the stated organization and corporate strategy; frequent and disruptive leadership shakeups in it; non-engineering roles - despite lip service are not valued; there is very little respect for work-life balance unless you put your own boundaries up - which is problematic especially as we strive to do better with <b>mental</b> health for ourselves and our co-workers.</li>
                      <li><b>Benefits</b> are very good and somewhat compensate for low pay.</li>
                      <li>Culture is lacking and poor work/life balance</li>
                      <li>Poor <b>culture</b>, layoff every year, low employee morale</li>
                      <li>Can be stressful and feel as though your underwater sometimes.
                      pay isn't the best for this industry, but most of the <b>benefits</b> make up for it.</li>
                      <li>Arrogance very high
                      legacy solutions not cloud friendly
                      middle management have rose colored glasses
                      too many gatekeeper inside the machine
                      most managers are spreadsheet jockeys, not leaders
                      elt is nose blind on how the trenches smell
                      ceo needs to fix machine, not be so concerned how he looks public facing
                      layoffs schedule is rampant 
                      not focused on customer but themselves
                      not too channel friendly</li>
                      <li>Salary, culture, ceo, team lead</li>
                      <li>Several first, second and third line managers do not embrace the <b>culture</b> and framework established by the slt.</li>

                      meetings and collaboration is so dysfunctional, even exec team warns employees that 'cisco will consume you if you let it', yet you are penalized if you do not devote 24/7 of your personal life to the company.

                      <li>Oh man after 4 years you definitely start seeing the cracks:
                       open <b>discrimination</b> against men is pretty tolerant here, i.e. i was told it was good that i was discriminated against because i'm not a minority.</li>
                      <li>No <b>diversity</b> in engineering workforce.</li>
                      <li>Not much work life balance- it’s very hard to truly be “off” when taking pto
                      not much diversity in sales teams- a lot of the reqs say “purple hair?</li>
                      <li>Too many lay-offs which creates an unstable culture and too much churn.</li>
                      <li>The culture is struggling to evolve, but the old culture has a stronghold - too engineering driven, too reactive, not proactive, in approach to software design.</li>
                      <li>Wish there was a better gym membership in the <b>benefits</b></li>
                      <li>As in all tech companies, are growing pains, in <b>culture</b>, lack of minorities.</li>
                      <li>Many managers will devise ways to get rid of those who don't agree with their opinions by withholding bonuses, prevent any movement to other teams, uncomfortable 1 conversations, etc.
                      
                      also the division between ftes and contractors is very apparent and the pay disparity is embarrassing as are the <b>benefits</b> (read none). although working from home was a nice benefit, none of the great <b>benefits</b> you'd like to find at a silicon valley company like free food and other services.</li>
                      <li>It's a highly bureaucratic culture that rushes from crisis to crisis without adequate strategic accountability.</li>
                      <li>Loyalty to employees not there all smoke and mirrors.
                      they layoff yearly and quarterly regardless of performance.
                      unless your indian  there is no <b>inclusion</b> or diversity
                      low compensation vs the industry and competitors</li>
                      <li>The individual performance only matters to a minimal extent as we keep hearing from our managers and directors over and over again that the bu did not get enough budget for promotions or hikes.</li>
                      <li>Hard to get promoted, jobs/tasks change constantly, low diversity</li>
                      <li>Large company <b>culture</b> due to infusion of very large company people</li>
                      <li>Short term thinking and wall street focus is killing the <b>culture</b> that was once great</li>
                      <li>The <b>culture</b> is no longer what it was once...</li>
                      <li>Crabs in a bucket <b>culture</b> due to the fact there are limited fte positions everyone is mostly contractor.</li>
                      <li>Lack of transparency of performance evaluations,  management sees middle management as expendable, no sense of urgency, layoff culture, job rotations are not as often as peers,  process, tools and training sub par for large company, lots of politics.</li>
                      <li>Little balance, strategies shirt on a dime, they say <b>diverse</b> but ipmore and more is swept under a run</li>
                      <li>Many times you are working extra hours on products or solutions that will never produce revenue.
                      we were looking over our shoulder every 4 years.
                      company is extremely biased towards hiring younger engineers.
                      <b>diversity</b> and <b>inclusion</b> only applies to employees and managers in the us.</li>
                      <li>So the senior engineers there are basically just going through the motions because the pay is pretty good, the <b>benefits</b> are basically second to none, and they don't want to lose that.</li>
                      <li>The great <b>culture</b> at cisco has really taken a hit in the last 6 months.</li>
                      <li>Lack of <b>diversity</b>.</li>
                      <li>Not equal opportunity employment.</li>
                      <li>Uneven <b>diversity</b> - too many clique racial groups. very cheap for employee <b>benefits</b>.</li>
                      <li>One team can have a great, cohesive <b>culture</b> while another can be isolating.</li>
                      <li>They talk a lot about collaboration <b>culture</b> but it is passive aggressive and lot of command and control. this <b>culture</b> is widely prevalent.</li>
                      <li>Lack of <b>benefits</b> like free food & snacks.</li>
                      <li>Advancement is slow and dependent on arbitrary metrics that workers have no visibility into
                      * i've been in my position 2 years without a single formal review of my abilities.
                      * the politics are absurd at times - you have to worry about hurting peoples' feelings, as cisco is very feel-good.</li>
                      <li>The team you're on largely determines whether the work you do is exciting vs. mundane, whether you can work from home or if you have to be in the office every day for scrum.
                      
                      in the end you are still working for an it company that heavily values technical skills and abilities (design, marketing, hr, is always going to be secondary to software engineering, database, front end dev, etc.) essentially you must have coding skills/abilities/understanding to succeed or work here.
                      
                      biggest con: the location.</li>
                      <li>Any global company comes with its bureaucratic challenges, but cisco maintains a <b>culture</b> of curiosity and innovation that encourages growth throughout your career through challenging the status quo.</li>
                      <li>Bad <b>benefits</b> and bonus system.</li>
                      <li>Mostly hard working <b>culture</b> - less balance on fun.</li>
                      <li>The choice of <b>benefits</b> could be better</li>
                      <li>In some bus employee growth is stunted because they are buried under unnecessary multi-level management chains
                      engineering lacks <b>diversity</b></li>
                      <li><b>Culture</b> becoming more ruthless - not the cisco we knew and loved; yearly reductions in staff; new c-level; lots of internal marketing to employees</li>
                      <li>One feels left out as the <b>culture</b> is pretty clannish if you get hired from the outside.</li>
                      <li>Negative <b>culture</b> and people trying to grab your role.</li>

                      <li>Not <b>diverse</b> in workplace (mostly middle aged men)</li>

                      <li>Hire and fire <b>culture</b>, poor mid-management level, too much discrepancies in salary and grade levels.</li>
                      <li>Poor mid-management; strategy & governance is lacking in some areas; performance + development process is broken; culture of internal competition is growing</li>

                      <li>Cisco's culture causes mental illness far too regularly. also, not enough support to avoid burnout - always connected culture leads to burnout - likely to be harassed by sales leadership quite often including evenings and weekends. they are actively covering up and misrepresenting the scale of the harm their sales teams are being subjected to by wilfully discriminating both financially and through their actions, against anyone who suffers mental ill health due to the stresses of the role. cisco discriminate against people who have mental health issues.</li>

                      people idling here for 10 or even 20 years without any work.
                      highly bureaucratic management, once if you reply or talk hard to a few leaders, they will turn entire company against you.</li>
                      <li><b>Mental</b> health deteriorated
                      - too much management.
                      - too much workload
                      - manager tell lies to get what they want from you.
                      - bomb of branding and <b>mental</b> manipulation.
                      - disregard your current skills and they make you expert on cisco-only products.</li>
                      <li>No <b>culture</b>, no fun holiday events, no bonding outside of work unless you are in inside sales.</li>
                      <li>Too laid back <b>culture</b>, slow growth</li>
                      <li>No major cons, excellent working <b>culture</b> and enviroment</li>
                      <li>Mismatch between cisco's corporate & regional management (latin) <b>culture</b>.
                      - old style (latin) management style.

                      inter-time-zone collaboration a working hours issue.</li>
                      <li>New leadership in my division drastically changed the culture, trust and real employee experience, you need to ensure that the culture the exec leadership believe in is adopted through the organisation</li>
                      <li>No growth, no financial <b>benefits</b>, no new challenging work.</li>
                      <li><b>Culture</b> sometimes could get too political</li>
                      <li>Promotions are limited and its more of a beauty contest than based on your <b>abilities</b></li>
                      <li>The strong vendor/contractor <b>culture</b> is definitely a con. it's like everyone's working for the company and they could be a full-time employee, but they're not, and that originates frustration and unnecessary competition, undermining the otherwise close to perfect <b>culture</b> the company has.</li>
                      <li>It’s an office <b>culture</b> of bullying, where if you don’t subscribe to toxic masculinity beliefs, you are belittled as a coleague and as a man. very toxic <b>culture</b>.</li>
                      <li>No <b>culture</b> in india cisco</li>
                      <li><b>Blind</b> limited restructuring will cause loss of intelligence leaving the company.</li>
                      <li>Office politics within certain regions is unhealthy and impacts on the employee's <b>mental</b> health.</li>
                      <li>Expect that the kind of <b>culture</b> you get from your cohort/ csap hub will change, depending on the country/hub you move to after the end of the program. some of the fantastic <b>culture</b> you are you used to looses panache; this is common when you move from a larger hub to a much smaller one.</li>
                      <li>Thankfully cisco is a constantly changing and adapting company and you find that management has to adapt as well.
                      
                      being a systems engineer can feel like a thankless role at times within the company, but the opportunity to work with cutting  edge technology and the <b>culture</b> in the company far far far outweigh this.
                      
                      generally it is accepted that cisco pays slightly less than others in the industry, however given the job security, additional benefits like health care, pension etc etc, i have always been happy with my pay.</li>
                      <li>The <b>culture</b> is deteriorating, poor work life balance, you are even asked to work on weekends and no comp offs given if the decision doesn't come from upper management.</li>
                      <li>No 13th months
                      health <b>benefits</b> required participation</li>
                      <li>Office politics, elitism, nepotism, hypocrisy lack of <b>diversity</b> (people of colour to be clear)</li>
                      <li>Good company with good <b>culture</b></li>
                      <li>Got more <b>benefits</b> from the company</li>
                      <li>Pockets of toxic culture
                      <b>benefits</b> are limited</li>
                      <li>Culture of nepotism, classicism etc.</li>
                      <li>Gender <b>discrimination</b> in the name if <b>diversity</b>, local sales management is flag bearer of nepotism.</li>
                      <li>It is no longer the cisco it was 5 to 10 years back, <b>culture</b> wise atleast.</li>
                      <li>We had a person on a team who was spending 50% of the time or more on some <b>inclusion</b> trainings and presentations and not doing the job mostly, and that is considered a norm, yet workload was counted toward them too (per person average).</li>
                      <li>Nothing as such,  cisco <b>culture</b> is best in word</li>
                      <li>Middle management in cisco krakow is really mediocre, and definitely not <b>diverse</b>. most managers are poles and while there's this appearance of <b>inclusion</b> and <b>diversity</b> within the company, at the end of the day you'll see locals (or ukranians, the second biggest community) progressing in their career,  getting promotions, recognitions, and so on... while it happens way too rarely for internationals (in proportion with the number of people, of course).
                      
                       being a low cost center in a saturated market like krakow, the quality of talent cisco manages to get there is not so high.
                      
                       no meritocracy at all.
                      
                       no metrics/kpi / good place for early retirement: you will find lots of people in who just put in a few hours of work per day, get to work at 10:00, leave at 15:000, go for groceries in the meantime... and nobody cares, because there is no way whatsoever to measure anybody's performance (beside in a very few roles).</li>
                      <li>All <b>benefits</b> makes you lazy in a way</li>
                      <li>Benefits on the downturn affecting the employees.</li>
                      <li>The uk sales management are bringing a political culture to cisco that it didn't have before.</li>
                      <li>Bad management, the company does not practice what they preach with their inclusion, diversity and bullying policy</li>
                      <li>Lay-off <b>culture</b>, too many reorgs, business units creating overlapping/competing solutions under the same domain, work life balance, promotions are based on social ladder instead of contribution ladder</li>
                      <li>Why expand in india if the team doesn't want it?
                      the team isn't <b>diverse</b> either.</li>
                      <li>Pay is rather low compare to the market
                      average <b>benefits</b>, few of them being taken away :(
                      there is few great people but the <b>culture</b> coming from the upper management is disgusting, saying you either with us or you should live ... not nery motivating on  convincing.</li>
                      <li>Slow moving constant changes <b>culture</b></li>
                      <li>Less stability, moderate work <b>culture</b>.</li>
