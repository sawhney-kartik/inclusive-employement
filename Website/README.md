To start off, use the command below:
`python -m pip install flask`

This will install flask on your local machine.

To start the flask application, follow these steps on the Terminal in the Website folder:
1. `set FLASK_ENV=development`
2. `set FLASK_APP=main.py`
3. `flask run`

The output would look like - 
 * `Serving Flask app "main.py" (lazy loading)`
 * `Environment: development`
 * `Debug mode: on`
 * `Restarting with windowsapi reloader`
 * `Debugger is active!`
 * `Debugger PIN: 242-974-026`
 * `Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)`
 
 Pick the URL from the last point that will redirect you to the web page.
