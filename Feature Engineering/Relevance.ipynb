In addition, Microsoft is backing the effort with $20 million in cash grants to help nonprofit organizations worldwide assist the people who need it most.

      "According to Microsoft calculations, global unemployment in 2020 may reach a quarter of a billion people. It is a staggering number. The pandemic respects no border. In the United States alone, the Congressional Budget Office estimates the country may witness a 12.3 point increase (from 3.5% to 15.8%) in the unemployment rate, equating to more than 21 million newly out-of-work people. Many other countries and continents face similar challenges.\n",

      "As we look to the future, we can draw insights from recessions in the past. Although recent recessions differed in their causes, each followed a trend of shedding low-skilled jobs and gradually replacing them with less automatable roles. In the late 1960s, roles that involved repetitive tasks involving manual work made up 34% of all jobs. These have been easier to automate, and as a result these jobs have now shrunk to 26% of all jobs. By contrast, jobs involving heavy cognition and problem-solving have simultaneously risen from 22% to 34%.\n",
      " \n",
      "This pattern is poised to repeat itself, with an added emphasis on a jobs recovery that requires an increasing focus on digital skills. There are two reasons this appears likely.\n",
      " \n",
      "Second, the economic recovery will take place amid the longer-term and already-unfolding wave of automation based on the new technologies that underpin what some have called theFourth Industrial Revolution. Over the next five years, we estimate that the global workforce can absorb around 149 million new technology-oriented jobs. Software development accounts for the largest single share of this forecast, but roles in related fields like data analysis, cyber security, and privacy protection are also poised to grow substantially.\n",
      " \n",
      "Of course, the magnitude and mixture of job growth will vary by country, industry, and sector. Although the impact will not be distributed evenly, digital transformation will touch virtually every corner of the global workforce — from food production (324,000 new jobs) to healthcare (2 million) and the automotive industry (6 million).\n",
      " \n",
      "All this is made more urgent because of a challenge that has been two decades in the making, namely the decline and then stagnation in employer investments in training. Employer investments in training grew substantially throughout the 1980s and 1990s, as personal computers and the internet reshaped the world’s workplaces. This trend ceased around the turn of the century, as the dot-com recession and 9/11 marked the start of a nearly decade-long decline in employer-based investment in training.\n",
      " \n",
      "Since 2008, the downward trend in employer-paid training has given way to a decade of stagnation, both in North America and around the world – notwithstanding a small spike in the wake of the Great Recession. Alarmingly, the trend of the past few years appears to be slightly negative. This contraction occurred despite the fact that the U.S. economy, which accounts forjust under halfof the global training market, was enjoying an unprecedented period of growth, and technological advances were beginning to reshape the modern workplace yet again.\n",
      " \n",
      "Exacerbating the challenge is the fact that existing training is not reaching the populations who need it most. On-the-job training far outpaces distance learning and other alternative modes, limiting options for prospective employees. Perhaps more significantly, on-the-job training is more than two times as prevalent among workers who are already in higher-skilled roles, leaving those in more automatable positions even more vulnerable to displacement.\n",
      " \n",
      "But technology is only a means to an end, not an end in itself. The same Pew survey also observed that 85% of respondents regarded “soft” skills like collaborating with others and communicating effectively as highly important. In other words, people-oriented “success skills” remain as essential as ever – perhaps even more so given their durability at a time when technology continues to evolve at breakneck speed. Although technology companies have an important role to play in helping close the skills gap, success will take a concerted effort among employers, nonprofits, governments, and other stakeholders. The task calls for renewed partnerships and redoubled investments in skills, ensuring that training reaches the broadest group of people with the greatest needs.\n",

      "As part of this new initiative,LinkedIn is sharingfree, real-time labor market data and skills insights to help governments, policymakers and business leaders understand what’s happening in their local labor markets: what companies are hiring, the top jobs companies are hiring for and the trending skills for those jobs.  This data can be accessed using a new interactive tool atlinkedin.com/workforce. Data is available for more than 180 countries and regions (150+ cities, 30+ countries). Users can search by country or region and download the data sets.\n",

      "We have also used the Economic Graph as a critical planning resource for today’s skills initiative, by identifying the key jobs and horizontal skills that are most widely in demand and creating learning paths for these via LinkedIn Learning. Using this data, we identified 10 jobs that are in-demand in today’s economy and are well positioned to continue to grow in the future. These 10 jobs were identified as having the greatest number of job openings, have had steady growth over the past four years, pay a livable wage, and require skills that can be learned online.\n",

      "To help people pursue jobs in these areas, we are making LinkedIn Learning paths aligned with each of these roles available free of charge through the end of March 2021. Each learning path includes a sequence of video content designed to help job seekers develop the core skills needed for each role. Each learning path is currently available in English, French, Spanish, and German.\n",
      " \n",
      "LinkedIn Learning’s library for each learning path also includes collaborative courses, all taught by industry-expert instructors, allowing individuals to move through content and demonstrate their learning with a certificate of completion. Covering a broad range of skills from entry-level digital literacy to advanced product-based skills for technology roles, these role-based learning paths provide numerous opportunities for people along a learning continuum to reskill and upskill. We believe these are the types of resources that can place in-demand roles within reach of millions of job seekers.\n",
      " \n",
      "In addition to these LinkedIn Learning paths, we are offering through Microsoft Learn free and in-depth technical learning content that also supports these roles. For roles that are more technical in nature, job seekers can go deeper on specific role-based Microsoft technologies with Microsoft Learn modules, gaining the most in-demand skills on widely used technologies.\n",

      "We will also enable job seekers pursuing developer roles to access the GitHub Learning Lab to practice their skills. GitHub Learning Lab is a bot-based learning tool that uses repositories to teach technology, coding, Git, and GitHub via real-life, demo-based modules. This means that as job seekers engage in learning paths, they will have the opportunity to practice newly acquired skills by completing realistic projects in a personalized GitHub repository.\n",

      "Today’s initiative also aims to help job seekers demonstrate their skills to potential employers. This part of our initiative has multiple parts.\n",
      " \n",
      "We have found that these certifications are a powerful asset for job seekers and those looking to advance in an existing role. For example, inGlobal Knowledge’s 2019 IT Skills and Salary Report, more than half of IT decision-makers surveyed believe the main benefit of certified individuals is their ability to close organizational skills gaps seen in an everchanging technology environment. It also showed certifications helped make hiring easier, helping job seekers stand out. Among other things, these certifications, as well as completion of a learning path on LinkedIn Learning, can be added to an individual’s LinkedIn profile.\n",
      " \n",
      "We are also making available tools to help individuals identify and pursue potential jobs. This includes a recently developed job interview preparation-feature, powered by MSFT-AI, to prepare and practice for job interviews. It also includes a new feature we are announcing today called #OpenToWork, which enables job seekers to surface to employers the roles for which they would like to be considered. Through a simple LinkedIn profile photo frame, #OpenToWork enables job seekers to let employers and the LinkedIn network know they are actively seeking a new opportunity, indicate the type of job they are looking for, express their needs for support, and get help from the LinkedIn community to find new opportunities.\n",
      " \n",
      "In addition, Microsoft and LinkedIn will continue to provide on-ramps for people from nontraditional backgrounds to successfully transition from learning skills to landing a job. This will include theMicrosoft Software & Systems Academy, or MSSA, which provides transitioning U.S. service members and veterans with technology skills. It also includesLeap, which Microsoft launched in 2015 to recruit, develop, upskill non-traditional talent, and create a connection to employability in the tech industry. And it includesREACH, which is a multi-year engineering apprenticeship program at LinkedIn.\n",

      "One creative example comes from Canada, where workers who risk displacement in an economic downturn are encouraged to develop individual training plans ranging from upgrading skills in current jobs to preparing for promotions and even training for jobs outside the company. This “Work-Sharing (WS)” program helps employers and employees avoid layoffs when there is a temporary reduction in the normal level of business activity beyond the control of an employer. It provides income support to employees eligible for employment insurance benefits who work a temporarily reduced work week while their employer recovers. WS is a three-party agreement involving employers, employees and Service Canada. Employees must agree to a reduced work schedule and to share the available work for a specified time. The impacted employees are compensated with salary for participation in skills enhancement training, whether on-the-job or at off-site courses, during the days/hours missed because of participation in the WS program.\n",

      "Good examples are plentiful. They include work in New Zealand, where the government has invested approximately $1 billion to make vocational training courses free for all ages over the next two years. In the United States, the Pledge to America’s Workers American Workforce Policy Advisory Board, established by the White House, is developing proposals focused on investments in learning pathways, skills-based hiring, and the modernization of education and training to accelerate reskilling and facilitate innovation in workforce development. Other examples include programs in countries such as Singapore and France to create Lifelong Learning Accounts or similar mechanisms that would allow individual employees, employers and, in some models, the public sector, to invest in training for individuals.\n",
      " \n",
      "To support this, we are developing and will preview a new learning app in Microsoft Teams later this year, to bring learning into the natural flow of work. People are already using Microsoft Teams for meetings, chat, calling, collaboration, and business processes, and we are planning to extend that to include learning. The Teams learning app will allow employers to integrate world-class content from LinkedIn Learning, Microsoft Learn, a customer’s own content, and other content providers all in one place, ranging from instructor-led training to shorter, micro-learning content. The app will empower managers to assign and track learning progress and enable employees to have conversations around the content while also earning certifications and recognition for their new skills. Whether a new employee is onboarding, a manager is looking to sharpen a team’s skills, or a first-line worker is in the field needing immediate training, this new app will create a seamless experience for employees to learn in the flow of work.\n",

      "If you’re excited about the possibility of landing a technical job at Microsoft, chances are you have a passion for coding, solving problems and the incredible things technology can do for people around the world.\n",
      " \n",
      "A technical interview is your chance to show you have the skills to match.\n",
      " \n",
      "But there’s no question that coding on the spot, in front of the very people you hope to work for, can be daunting. What can you expect? How do you prepare? What are your interviewers looking for? Several Microsoft recruiters agreed to share their best tips — including a few surprising ones — to help you ace it.\n",
      " \n",
      "“Hiring managers generally want to see how you think, not just that you can,” says Kenji Yamaguchi, a senior talent acquisition manager whose team recruits for various roles across Microsoft Office. “They also want to see that you care about the quality of the product you ship and the experience our customers will have.”\n",
      " \n",
      "They’re also often the first step before you’re brought in for a day of more traditional interviews, so it’s crucial to do all you can to make it count.\n",
      " \n",
      "It’s a good idea to brush up on some of the basics beforehand, according to recruiter Abby Arvanitidis, who brings in engineering and program management candidates for OneDrive and SharePoint. She says there are loads of online resources to help you sharpen your skills.\n",
      " \n",
      "In an in-person interview, you’ll likely be asked to code on a whiteboard. If it’s by phone, you’ll probably use a code editor that allows the interviewers to see your screen and watch you work in real time. In that case, Arvanitidis says, make sure you have a reliable Internet connection in a quiet place where you won’t be interrupted.\n",
      " \n",
      "“The technical interviews for my teams usually focus on technical depth, passion for technology, interest in Microsoft, analytical ability and being able to adapt on the fly,” she says.\n",
      " \n",
      "Chandrasekharan says her team looks for a passion for technology to assess candidates’ capacity to think creatively and come up with new ideas. It’s also helpful to be able to articulate what you want out of your next job and your career.\n",
      " \n",
      "The coding portion of your interview\n",
      " \n",
      "When it comes to coding, your interviewers may give you an open-ended question with some variables and ask you to code a solution. You might hope to show you’re eager and ambitious by diving right in — but don’t, advises Arvanitidis.\n",
      " \n",
      "Explaining what you’re doing as you go not only helps make sure you understand what’s being asked, it might also help you get tips from an unexpected source: your interviewers. After all, they want you to succeed.\n",
      " \n",
      "“Try to talk out loud through your thinking process,” Chandrasekharan says. “This will help the interviewer follow your line of thinking and give you guidance along the way.”\n",
      " \n",
      "Just what, exactly, are the interviewers looking for? Chandrasekharan offers this list to get you thinking of how to let your best traits shine through:\n",
      " \n",
      "Strong communication, of course, is key in any interview. Make sure you understand what’s being asked of you, and watch the interviewers for clues that show they’re following what you’re saying.\n",
      " \n",
      "“I like to remind candidates that the interviewers are not omnipotent mind readers; they’re just people — who hopefully end up being your future coworkers,” Yamaguchi explains. “I’ve seen more than a handful of occasions where candidates have accidentally answered different questions than they were asked, or have overcomplicated their answers due to a communication mix-up.”\n",
      " \n",
      "Don’t forget to ask questions about what’s important to you, your interests and your career objectives, Yamaguchi says. Interviews are a two-way street, and you should make sure the role is the right fit for you. Along those lines, he strongly recommends one more thing: “Be authentic,” he says. “Be you.” And if you mess up your coding or completely botch a response? It happens. It might even work in your favor, depending on how you handle it.\n",
      " \n",
      "“Sometimes showing you are agile on your feet and receptive to feedback can be even better than acing all of your interview questions,” Yamaguchi says. “It proves you have potential to grow.”\n",

      "Outside of food and weather related topics, the other thing I hear the most is how surprised they are to learn about the variety of services and benefits that Intel makes available.  Many of them applied for a job at Intel not knowing much, if anything, about our benefits.  Made me realize, I probably need to do a better job of getting the word out on these “secret” benefits.  So, here we go!\n",

(For those of you in theexperiencedspace, these tips can be valuable to you as well!) Hopefully some of the insights will help you be prepared and ultimately land your dream ‘gig’ at Intel. I decided I didn’t want to just supply you with MY insights – so I interviewed some of my peers for this post and hope you find their tips to be helpful!\n",
      " \n",
      "1. “Be very flexible on times/dates for interview–make yourself available!”\n",
      " \n",
      "3. “Try to be open to an extended internship– not just the summer. Many hiring managers want to get more return on their investment, so they hire people that have time to train, and then give the student more time to produce quality work! ? Yes, we do still hire people for three-month summer internships, but more frequently we hire for a 4-6 month time period.”\n",

      "Next, I interviewedCath, a Campus Relations Manager for five of Intel’s focus schools (MIT,University of Michigan,Michigan State,Howard, andUniversity of Maryland, College Park). She has worked at Intel over 10 years in a variety of staffing roles, and loves being part of the process that brings the best and brightest students to Intel!\n",
      " \n",
      "1. “Do your research on Intel – be prepared to ask several intelligent, well-prepared questions on Intel or specifically the business group you are interviewing with. Don’t ask ‘What does Intel do…?’”\n",
      " \n",
      "Leighwas my next interviewee; you can find her at these Intel focus schools:Purdue,UC Berkeley,USC, andUniversity of Texas, Austin. She started her career at Intel as an intern and then was hired as a college graduate! Ten years later Leigh still thinks she made a great choice coming to work here! She’s had a variety of different roles at Intel.\n",

      "“Students should work on preparing for behavioral interview questions as well as technical. They should think back on a variety of experiences to draw on to answer behavioral questions (jobs, internships, school projects, school teams, etc.)”\n",
      " \n",
      "Leigh makes a very valid point. Intel likes to be sure we are hiring people that will thrive in our fast-paced environment. This means being able to adapt to change, collaborate and innovate. Behavioral interviewing helps us find peoples’ strengths and weaknesses in an alternative way. We try NOT to ask the boring question that everyone hates to answer.\n",
      " \n",
      "Hopefully these tips will help you better prepare for an interview with Intel. Typically, we start off with a phone screen to assess your technical skills. Then, if you pass that test, we may fly you in to join us onsite for a larger round of interviews.\n",
      " \n",
      "On a final note, we strive to hire interns that we feel confident we would want to convert into college graduate hires! This means we are thorough interviewing both interns and new grads alike! Being prepared is the ultimate way to ensure a successful interview with Intel.\n",

      "Hey Tiffany, It’s your teammate Burke here.  When I interviewed with Intel a few years back, I was very surprised at how much the interviewer wanted to dig into a few of the key projects that I had listed on my resume. They wanted to know about my methods, strategy, decision making process, and the challenges that I faced.  What did I learn in the end?  What would I have done differently?   It was actually quite relief to talk about stuff that I was very familiar with.  I could have even taken more time before the interview to organize my thoughts around my key projects.\n",

      "The primary focus of this program is to provide opportunities for Microsoft Real Estate and Facilities (RE&F) vendors to employ people with I/DD. People with I/DD often need initial and long-term job training and support from their selected coaching agency to secure and maintain meaningful employment with opportunities for career growth and progression.\n",

      "Here are some examples of the 30+ job types filled by Supported Employees with Microsoft’s vendor partners:\n",

      "Supported Employees are paid by their employer. Vendors hire Supported Employees within existing labor budgets within the Real Estate and Facilities scope for roles that they need to fill.\n",
      " \n",
      "Coaches work for employment coaching agencies, which are usually non-profits funded by government entities. Employers do not pay a fee to the coaching agencies.\n",
      " \n",
      "Job opportunities are collaboratively identified by the vendor employers and the program manager.\n",
      " \n",
      "We partnered with our vendor employers and challenged them to look at open roles and opportunities and ask, “Could this role by filled by an individual with an I/DD?” As opportunities are identified, the program manager shares job requisitions with all employment agency partners.\n",
      " \n",
      "When a vendor has a job opening for a Supported Employee, the program manager notifies the coaching agency partners. The agencies determine which individuals are best suited and qualified for the specific job opening, and assist those individuals with applying, interviewing, onboarding, and ongoing job coaching.\n",

      "Coaching agencies are our partner for sourcing candidates whose skills and interests are a good fit for a vendor’s positions and teams.

      "That spectrum includes many types of people who have talent and passion and who can help change the world. People like Joey Chemis, who came to work at Microsoft through the company’s program to recruit and hire people with autism, a program that started two years ago.\n",
      " \n",
      "Researchers estimate the unemployment and underemployment rates for people on the autism spectrum are 70–90 percent. That was the frustrating reality for Chemis: he had advanced skills in math and was excited to put them to use, but he couldn’t get interviews. While he was working minimum-wage jobs, he knew he was “destined for something more.”\n",
      " \n",
      "Through Microsoft’s efforts to hire employees on the autism spectrum, recruiters and hiring managers also put an emphasis on looking at a candidate’s background holistically. For instance, someone might have advanced degrees but be working at a big-box store. “Because of that, there might be this perception of why someone doesn’t have a job in their field,” Guadagno said. To better assess experience, recruiters also look at technical projects and relevant volunteer work. “Just because you’re not working in your desired career, it doesn’t eliminate you.”\n",
      " \n",
      "Once the candidate is invited to a hiring event, a process that includes team-building exercises and mock interviews with feedback helps them feel supported. A technical skills assessment “helps to drive more insight into someone’s skills and experience and puts more focus on their ability to do the job,” Guadagno said.\n",
      " \n",
      "If Chemis could somehow go back and advise his younger self about the future, he says that he would say this: “You’re going to do really cool things. You’re going to end up getting a really cool job at Microsoft.”\n",

      "If you’re not sure what to ask, here are ten phone interview questions to bring up during a phone screening and what the answers can tell you.\n",
      " \n",
      "Use this commonly-asked question to figure out whether the candidate left for reasonable cause or because he or she has difficulty getting along with others or putting up with minor inconveniences on the job. You want to hire someone who will remain committed to your business for the long haul.\n",
      " \n",
      "Use phone interview questions such as “Can you travel/lift heavy loads/stand for long periods at a time?” to screen out candidates who don’t meet the physical requirements of a job. For example, an answer of “No” on the question “Can you travel for work?” is disqualifying for a sales role that requires a lot of time outside of the office and meeting with clients.\n",
      " \n",
      "If hiring for a leadership role, ask this question to gauge whether the candidate has a proven record in leadership. The answer may reveal that a person is more of a follower than a leader. The candidate should also give a concrete example of a successful project that he played a major role in from start to finish.\n",
      " \n",
      "The answer to this question will tell you whether the candidate is capable of overcoming on-the-job hurdles such as conflicting deadlines or conflicting personalities. Candidates who remained flexible and adaptable are more likely to handle obstacles with ease and grace in their new role.\n",
      " \n",
      "The ideal candidate willprioritize the most urgent dutyat hand above others of lesser priority. Let’s say the interviewee identifies a trivial matter for this question. Her answer might signal that she would get bogged down in details and overlook big-picture problems if hired.\n",
      " \n",
      "An engaged candidate will rarely give a “No” for this question. He will raise phone interview questions about his specific role, the organizational hierarchy or another question about the business to convey his knowledge and interest. The answer can also help reassure you as the interviewer that the candidate sees himself working at your business.\n",

Until recently, AI was accessible only by a select few, requiring intensive research, compute power and significant funding. We are now entering an era of commoditised and democratised narrow focused AI, more widely available to a much broader market. A wide range of tools already exist to enable the sophisticated development of AI and Machine Learning (ML) rapidly and cost-effectively. In 2020, leading organisations will aim to scale AI in order to enhance and differentiate their business. Specifically, we will see deployment of cognitive technology in sectors such as oil and gas (autonomous rigs), construction and manufacturing (digital twins), retail (behaviour) and healthcare (multiomics*). While data quality and use is and will continue to be important, this pending proliferation of AI will require a shift in focus from data inputs to the quality and outcomes of AI outputs. Given that AI is now entering its next phase of deeper and wider integration into business and society, with significant and potentially ominous implications, oversight and governance in the form of industry guidelines, organisational ethical frameworks and possibly regulation, will become increasingly common.\n",
